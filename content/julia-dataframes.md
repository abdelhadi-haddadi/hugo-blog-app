# Julia DataFrames

last modified March 8, 2025

The DataFrames package in Julia is a robust tool for handling
structured data, akin to pandas in Python or data frames in R. This tutorial
dives into both basic and advanced data manipulation techniques with practical,
real-world examples.

With DataFrames, you can clean messy datasets, transform data for
analysis, and perform complex operations like joins and aggregations. It's a
cornerstone for data science in Julia.

## Install DataFrames

Let's start by installing the DataFrames package in Julia.

install.jl
  

using Pkg
Pkg.add("DataFrames")

The using Pkg line loads Julia's package manager. Then,
Pkg.add("DataFrames") fetches and installs the DataFrames package
from Julia's package registry. Run this in the Julia REPL or a script.

## Create a DataFrame

Here's how to create a DataFrame representing employee records.

create.jl
  

using DataFrames
df = DataFrame(
    EmployeeID = [101, 102, 103],
    Name = ["Alice Smith", "Bob Jones", "Clara Lee"],
    Department = ["Sales", "IT", "HR"],
    Salary = [55000.0, 72000.0, 48000.0]
)
println(df)

This creates a DataFrame with four columns: EmployeeID,
Name, Department, and Salary. Each column
is an array of values. The println(df) line displays the table in
the console, showing a neatly formatted output.

This example mimics a small company dataset, making it relatable for business
data analysis tasks.

## Load Data from CSV

Loading real-world data often involves reading CSV files. Here's an example.

load_csv.jl
  

using CSV, DataFrames
df = CSV.read("sales_data.csv", DataFrame)
println(first(df, 5))

First, include CSV and DataFrames. The
CSV.read function loads "sales_data.csv" into a DataFrame. Assume
"sales_data.csv" contains columns like OrderID,
Product, Quantity, and Price.

println(first(df, 5)) shows the first 5 rows, useful for quickly
inspecting large datasets. This is a common task in data analysis workflows.

## Filter Rows

Filtering is key for extracting relevant data. Here's an example with sales.

filter.jl
  

using DataFrames
df = DataFrame(
    OrderID = [1, 2, 3],
    Product = ["Laptop", "Mouse", "Monitor"],
    Quantity = [5, 20, 3],
    Price = [1200.0, 25.0, 300.0]
)
high_value = filter(row -&gt; row.Price * row.Quantity &gt; 1000, df)
println(high_value)

This creates a sample sales DataFrame. The filter function selects
rows where the total value (Price * Quantity) exceeds 1000. The
lambda function row -&gt; row.Price * row.Quantity &gt; 1000
evaluates each row.

The result, high_value, might include "Laptop" and "Monitor" orders,
helping identify high-value transactions in a business context.

## Sort DataFrame

Sorting helps organize data. Here's how to sort employees by salary.

sort.jl
  

using DataFrames
df = DataFrame(
    Name = ["Alice", "Bob", "Clara"],
    Salary = [55000, 72000, 48000]
)
sorted_df = sort(df, :Salary, rev=true)
println(sorted_df)

The sort function orders the DataFrame by Salary. The
rev=true argument sorts in descending order, so Bob (72000) appears
first, followed by Alice and Clara.

This is useful for ranking employees by compensation or prioritizing high-cost
items in a budget analysis.

## Add a New Column

Adding columns enhances data. Here, we calculate annual bonuses.

add_column.jl
  

using DataFrames
df = DataFrame(
    Name = ["Alice", "Bob"],
    Salary = [55000.0, 72000.0]
)
df[!, :Bonus] = df.Salary .* 0.1
println(df)

The df[!, :Bonus] syntax adds a Bonus column. We
calculate it as 10% of Salary using the element-wise multiplication
operator .*. Alice gets 5500, Bob gets 7200.

The ! means the operation modifies df in place,
which is efficient for large datasets.

## Group and Aggregate

Grouping summarizes data. Here's an example with sales by product category.

group.jl
  

using DataFrames, Statistics
df = DataFrame(
    Category = ["Electronics", "Electronics", "Office"],
    Sales = [1200.0, 300.0, 50.0]
)
grouped = combine(groupby(df, :Category), :Sales =&gt; mean =&gt; :AvgSales)
println(grouped)

The groupby function groups rows by Category.
combine then computes the mean of Sales per group,
renaming it AvgSales. Electronics averages 750, Office is 50.

This is practical for summarizing sales performance across product lines in a
retail dataset.

## Join DataFrames

Joining combines datasets. Here, we merge employee and department data.

join.jl
  

using DataFrames
employees = DataFrame(
    ID = [101, 102],
    Name = ["Alice", "Bob"]
)
depts = DataFrame(
    ID = [101, 102],
    Dept = ["Sales", "IT"]
)
joined = innerjoin(employees, depts, on=:ID)
println(joined)

We create two DataFrames: employees with names and IDs, and
depts with department info. innerjoin merges them on
ID, keeping only matching rows.

The result pairs Alice with Sales and Bob with IT, simulating a real HR system
lookup.

## Handle Missing Data

Real data often has gaps. Here's how to handle missing values.

missing.jl
  

using DataFrames
df = DataFrame(
    Name = ["Alice", "Bob", "Clara"],
    Score = [85, missing, 90]
)
cleaned = dropmissing(df)
println(cleaned)

The DataFrame has a missing value in Score.
dropmissing removes rows with any missing data, so Bob's row is
excluded, leaving Alice and Clara.

This is critical for preparing data for statistical models that can't handle
missing values.

## Export Data to CSV

Saving results is common. Here's how to export a DataFrame to CSV.

export.jl
  

using CSV, DataFrames
df = DataFrame(
    Product = ["Laptop", "Mouse"],
    Price = [1200.0, 25.0]
)
CSV.write("output.csv", df)

CSV.write saves the DataFrame to "output.csv". This file can be
opened in Excel or shared with colleagues, making it a practical step in data
workflows.

## Best Practices for DataFrames

**Use Descriptive Column Names:** Prefer TotalSales
    over TS for clarity.
**Handle Missing Data:** Use dropmissing or
    replace to clean data.
**Optimize Performance:** Use @time to benchmark
    operations on large datasets.
**Document Your Code:** Comment steps like "Group by region to
    calculate average revenue".
