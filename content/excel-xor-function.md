# Excel XOR Function

last modified April 4, 2025

The XOR function is a logical function in Excel that performs an 
exclusive OR operation. It returns TRUE when an odd number of conditions are 
TRUE, and FALSE otherwise. This tutorial provides a comprehensive guide to 
using the XOR function with detailed examples. You'll learn basic 
syntax, practical applications, and how it differs from other logical functions.

## XOR Function Basics

The XOR function performs an exclusive OR operation on multiple 
logical conditions. Unlike OR which returns TRUE if any condition is TRUE, XOR 
returns TRUE only when an odd number of conditions are TRUE.

  
    Component
    Description
  
  
    Function Name
    XOR
  
  
    Syntax
    =XOR(logical1, [logical2], ...)
  
  
    Arguments
    1-254 logical conditions
  
  
    Return Value
    TRUE or FALSE
  

This table breaks down the essential components of the XOR
function. It shows the function name, basic syntax format, argument limits, and
return value characteristics.

## Basic XOR Example

This example demonstrates the simplest use of the XOR function with two logical 
conditions.

Basic XOR formula
  

=XOR(TRUE, FALSE)

This formula compares TRUE and FALSE. The result will be TRUE because exactly 
one condition is TRUE. XOR returns TRUE when an odd number of conditions are 
TRUE.

## XOR with Multiple Conditions

XOR can evaluate multiple conditions. This example shows how it behaves with 
three logical values.

  
    A
    B
    C
  
  
    TRUE
    TRUE
    FALSE
  
  
    
    
    =XOR(A1, B1, C1)
  

The table shows three logical values and an XOR formula evaluating them. With 
two TRUEs and one FALSE, the result will be FALSE because the number of TRUE 
conditions is even.

XOR with multiple conditions
  

=XOR(A1, B1, C1)

This formula evaluates A1 (TRUE), B1 (TRUE), and C1 (FALSE). The result is 
FALSE because there's an even number (2) of TRUE conditions. XOR returns TRUE 
only for odd counts of TRUE conditions.

## XOR with Cell References

A practical use of XOR involves referencing cells containing 
logical values. Here's an example with cell references.

  
    A
    B
    C
  
  
    TRUE
    FALSE
    
  
  
    FALSE
    TRUE
    
  
  
    
    
    =XOR(A1:B2)
  

This table demonstrates XOR evaluating a range of cells (A1:B2) containing 
logical values. The formula will check how many TRUE values exist in the range.

XOR with cell range
  

=XOR(A1:B2)

This formula evaluates all cells in A1:B2. With two TRUE values (A1 and B2), 
the result is FALSE because the count of TRUEs is even. XOR treats ranges by 
counting all TRUE values in the range.

## XOR with Numeric Values

XOR automatically converts numeric values to logical values where 0 = FALSE and 
any other number = TRUE. This example demonstrates this behavior.

  
    A
    B
    C
  
  
    1
    0
    
  
  
    5
    0
    
  
  
    
    
    =XOR(A1:B2)
  

The table shows numeric values being evaluated by XOR. The formula converts 
these to logical values before performing the exclusive OR operation.

XOR with numeric values
  

=XOR(A1:B2)

This formula evaluates A1 (1=TRUE), B1 (0=FALSE), A2 (5=TRUE), B2 (0=FALSE). 
There are two TRUE values, so XOR returns FALSE. This automatic conversion makes 
XOR flexible for different data types.

## XOR with Text Values

XOR treats text values as TRUE unless they're empty strings. This example shows 
how text is evaluated in XOR operations.

  
    A
    B
    C
  
  
    "Yes"
    "No"
    
  
  
    ""
    "Maybe"
    
  
  
    
    
    =XOR(A1:B2)
  

This table demonstrates XOR evaluating text values. Empty strings are treated as 
FALSE, while any other text is treated as TRUE in the calculation.

XOR with text values
  

=XOR(A1:B2)

The formula evaluates A1 ("Yes"=TRUE), B1 ("No"=TRUE), A2 (""=FALSE), B2 
("Maybe"=TRUE). With three TRUE values, XOR returns TRUE because the count is 
odd. This behavior is useful for text-based conditions.

## XOR in Conditional Formatting

XOR can be used in conditional formatting rules to create alternating patterns. 
This example shows how to apply it.

XOR in conditional formatting
  

=XOR(MOD(ROW(),2)=1, MOD(COLUMN(),2)=1)

This formula creates a checkerboard pattern by XORing row and column parity. 
When used in conditional formatting, it will alternate formatting between cells. 
The XOR ensures the pattern inverts properly at each intersection.

The XOR function is a powerful tool for logical operations where 
you need to detect an odd number of TRUE conditions. Unlike OR and AND, XOR 
provides unique functionality for parity checking and alternating patterns. 
Mastering XOR expands your ability to create complex logical tests in Excel.
