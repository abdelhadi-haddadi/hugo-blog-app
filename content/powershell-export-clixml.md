# PowerShell Export-Clixml

last modified February 15, 2025

This article covers the Export-Clixml cmdlet in PowerShell. It
serializes objects to XML files for storage or transfer. The cmdlet preserves
object structure and properties. It's useful for saving complex data between
sessions.

## CLIXML basics

CLIXML is PowerShell's custom XML-based serialization format. It maintains
object structure and type information. Export-Clixml creates
files that can be imported with Import-Clixml. The format is
optimized for PowerShell objects. It's not intended for cross-platform use.

## Basic Export-Clixml usage

The simplest usage exports a single object to an XML file. Specify the input
object and output file path. The cmdlet automatically creates the XML
representation. The file can be later imported to recreate the object.

export1.ps1
  

Get-Process -Name "notepad" | Export-Clixml -Path "notepad_process.xml"

This exports Notepad process information to an XML file. The output contains
all process properties. The file can be imported to recreate the Process object.

## Exporting multiple objects

Export-Clixml can handle collections of objects. The entire
collection is serialized to a single file. When imported, the original
collection structure is preserved. This works with arrays and other collections.

export2.ps1
  

Get-Process | Where-Object { $_.CPU -gt 10 } | Export-Clixml -Path "busy_processes.xml"

This exports all processes using more than 10 CPU seconds. The resulting
file contains an array of Process objects. Each maintains its properties
and methods.

## Exporting custom objects

You can export any PowerShell object, including custom ones. This example
creates and exports a custom object. The XML preserves all property values.
The object type information is also stored.

export3.ps1
  

$user = [PSCustomObject]@{
    Name = "John Doe"
    Age = 35
    Department = "IT"
}
$user | Export-Clixml -Path "user_profile.xml"

This creates a custom user object and exports it. The XML file contains all
properties with their values. The object type is preserved for import.

## Exporting secure strings

Export-Clixml can securely export sensitive data like passwords.
It uses Windows Data Protection API for encryption. Only the same user on the
same machine can decrypt it. This is safer than plain text storage.

export4.ps1
  

$secureString = Read-Host -AsSecureString -Prompt "Enter password"
$secureString | Export-Clixml -Path "password.xml"

This securely stores a password prompt response. The data is encrypted using
the current user's credentials. It can only be decrypted by the same user.

## Comparing with Export-Csv

Unlike Export-Csv, Export-Clixml preserves object
type and structure. CSV is plain text and loses type information. CLIXML is
better for complex objects and later rehydration. CSV is better for portability.

export5.ps1
  

Get-Service | Select-Object -First 5 | Export-Clixml -Path "services.xml"
Get-Service | Select-Object -First 5 | Export-Csv -Path "services.csv"

This shows both export methods side by side. The XML file preserves the
ServiceController objects. The CSV only contains property values as text.

## Depth parameter for nested objects

The -Depth parameter controls how many levels of nested objects
are serialized. Default is 2, which may truncate complex objects. Increase
this for deeply nested structures. Higher values increase file size.

export6.ps1
  

$complexObject = Get-Process -Name "powershell" | Select-Object -Property *
$complexObject | Export-Clixml -Path "deep_process.xml" -Depth 5

This exports a PowerShell process with all properties. The increased depth
ensures nested objects are fully serialized. The file will be larger but
more complete.

## Exporting for cross-session use

CLIXML files are primarily for PowerShell-to-PowerShell transfer. They can
be used to save state between sessions. The files are machine-specific for
some object types. They're not suitable for cross-platform sharing.

export7.ps1
  

$sessionData = @{
    Time = Get-Date
    User = $env:USERNAME
    Processes = Get-Process
}
$sessionData | Export-Clixml -Path "session_state.xml"

This exports various session information to a file. The data can be imported
in another session. Some objects may not work across different machines.

basic and advanced usage scenarios. The cmdlet is powerful for object
serialization. It's particularly useful for PowerShell-specific data storage.
