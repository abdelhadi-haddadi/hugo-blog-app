# Angular - Error Handling

URL: https://www.tutorialspoint.com/angular/angular-error-handling.htm

Errorsare the unexpected issue or problem that occurs during the execution of a program. Incorrect syntax, invalid input, system failures or bug in API logic could be the possible reasons for these errors. These errors may affect the user experience in negative way, hence, it is necessary to handle them at compile time.

Error handlingis the process of detecting and resolving these errors or exceptions before execution. Angular provides a number of ways to handle the errors that we are going to learn in this tutorial.

There are multiple ways to handle errors inAngular, which are given below −

TheErrorHandleris a built-in class of the Angular@angular/corepackage. It provides a hook to catch errors globally. When something goes wrong, like any unhandled exception occurs anywhere in the application, this class catches that exception and prints the error messages on console.

Remember! the ErrorHandler class simply prints the error message so that developers can see what went wrong and fix it. However, you can replace this default behavior by creating a custom ErrorHandler.

Extend theErrorHandlerclass and override itshandleError()method as shown below to create a custom behavior of this class −

TheHttpInterceptoris an interface that is used for handling HTTP-specific errors, such as network issues, server errors, etc. It can intercept and modify HTTP requests or responses. Think of it as a service that can check and change the data going to and coming from a server.

To use anHttpInterceptor, create a class that implements the HttpInterceptor interface and define theintercept()method. This method takes an HTTP request and a handler, and it returns an observable of the HTTP event. Inside this method, you can modify the request or response as needed.

In Angular, errors can occur during component lifecycle. To handle these errors, you can use the a try-catch block within thengOnInit(), which is acomponent lifecycle hookdefined byOnInitinterface. It is important to implement this interface as it helps to check if component is properly initialized.

Thetry blockis used to wrap the code that might throw an error during its execution. And, thecatch blockis used to handle any errors or exceptions that occur within the try block.

Here, you can see a component with try-catch block:

Validation is used inAngular Formsto validate whether the user input is in the correct format or not before submission. Thereactive formsandtemplate-driven formshas built-in validators to handle validation errors.

With reactive forms, you can easily validate user input and display custom error messages as shown in the following code block −
