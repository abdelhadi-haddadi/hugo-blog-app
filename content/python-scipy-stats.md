# Python SciPy Stats

last modified March 8, 2025

This tutorial explores statistical analysis in Python using the
scipy.stats module, part of the SciPy library, ideal for advanced
data science tasks.

The scipy.stats module offers tools for descriptive statistics,
probability distributions, and hypothesis testing, far exceeding the basic
capabilities of Python's statistics module.

## Install SciPy

$ pip install scipy

Install SciPy using pip to access the stats module
and its powerful statistical functions.

## SciPy Stats Mean and Median

The **mean** is the average of a dataset, while the
**median** is the middle value when sorted, robust against
outliers.

mean_median.py
  

#!/usr/bin/python

from scipy import stats
import numpy as np

sales = [1200, 1500, 1300, 1700, 5000]  # Monthly sales in USD
mean = np.mean(sales)
median = np.median(sales)

print(f"Mean Sales: ${mean:.2f}")
print(f"Median Sales: ${median:.2f}")

We import scipy.stats and numpy for efficient array
operations. The sales list represents monthly revenue. We use
np.mean and np.median for calculations.

The mean ($2,340) is skewed by the outlier ($5,000), while the median ($1,500)
better reflects typical sales, showing scipy.stats integration
with NumPy.

$ ./mean_median.py
Mean Sales: $2340.00
Median Sales: $1500.00

## SciPy Stats Mode

The **mode** identifies the most frequent value in a dataset,
useful for categorical or discrete data analysis.

mode.py
  

#!/usr/bin/python

from scipy import stats

ratings = [5, 4, 5, 3, 4, 5, 2, 4, 5]  # Customer satisfaction scores
mode_result = stats.mode(ratings)

print(f"Mode: {mode_result.mode[0]}, Count: {mode_result.count[0]}")

The ratings list simulates customer feedback (1-5 scale).
stats.mode returns a ModeResult object with
mode (most frequent value) and count (its frequency).
Here, 5 appears 4 times.

$ ./mode.py
Mode: 5, Count: 4

## SciPy Stats Variance and Standard Deviation

The **variance** measures data spread as the average squared
difference from the mean. The **standard deviation**, its square
root, indicates typical deviation in original units.

var_stdev.py
  

#!/usr/bin/python

from scipy import stats
import numpy as np

temps = [22.5, 23.0, 21.8, 24.1, 22.9]  # Daily temperatures (°C)
variance = np.var(temps, ddof=1)  # Sample variance
stdev = np.std(temps, ddof=1)     # Sample standard deviation

print(f"Variance: {variance:.2f} °C²")
print(f"Standard Deviation: {stdev:.2f} °C")

We use temperature data to compute sample variance and standard deviation
(ddof=1 for sample, not population). Variance (0.85 °C²) shows
spread in squared units, while standard deviation (0.92 °C) is more
interpretable.

$ ./var_stdev.py
Variance: 0.85 °C²
Standard Deviation: 0.92 °C

## SciPy Stats Normal Distribution

The **normal distribution** models continuous data with a
bell-shaped curve, defined by mean and standard deviation, common in natural
phenomena.

normal_dist.py
  

#!/usr/bin/python

from scipy import stats

# IQ scores: mean=100, std=15
iq_dist = stats.norm(loc=100, scale=15)
prob_above_120 = 1 - iq_dist.cdf(120)
sample = iq_dist.rvs(size=5)

print(f"P(IQ &gt; 120): {prob_above_120:.3f}")
print(f"Random IQs: {sample}")

We model IQ scores with a normal distribution (loc = mean,
scale = std). cdf(120) gives the cumulative
probability up to 120, so 1 - cdf is the chance of exceeding 120.
rvs generates random samples.

This is useful for simulations or probability assessments in psychology or
education.

$ ./normal_dist.py
P(IQ &gt; 120): 0.091
Random IQs: [ 95.2 112.7  88.4 104.1  99.6]  # Values may vary

## SciPy Stats T-Test

A **t-test** compares means to assess if differences are
statistically significant, widely used in hypothesis testing.

ttest.py
  

#!/usr/bin/python

from scipy import stats

group1 = [85, 88, 90, 87, 86]  # Test scores, method A
group2 = [90, 92, 89, 94, 91]  # Test scores, method B
t_stat, p_val = stats.ttest_ind(group1, group2)

print(f"T-Statistic: {t_stat:.2f}")
print(f"P-Value: {p_val:.3f}")

We compare test scores from two teaching methods. ttest_ind
performs an independent t-test, returning the t-statistic and p-value. A low
p-value (&lt;0.05) suggests a significant difference.

Here, p=0.013 indicates method B likely improves scores, a common analysis in
educational research.

$ ./ttest.py
T-Statistic: -2.98
P-Value: 0.013

## SciPy Stats Correlation

The **correlation coefficient** measures the linear relationship
between two variables, ranging from -1 (perfect negative) to 1 (perfect
positive).

correlation.py
  

#!/usr/bin/python

from scipy import stats

hours = [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]         # Study hours
scores = [65, 70, 75, 85, 90]  # Exam scores
r, p = stats.pearsonr(hours, scores)

print(f"Pearson Correlation: {r:.2f}")
print(f"P-Value: {p:.3f}")

We test if study hours correlate with exam scores.
pearsonr computes Pearson's correlation coefficient and p-value.
A high r (0.97) and low p-value (0.006) confirm a strong positive
relationship.

$ ./correlation.py
Pearson Correlation: 0.97
P-Value: 0.006

## SciPy Stats Kurtosis

The **kurtosis** measures the "tailedness" of a distribution,
indicating whether data has heavy or light tails compared to a normal
distribution. Positive kurtosis means heavy tails (more outliers), while
negative means light tails.

kurtosis.py
  

#!/usr/bin/python

from scipy import stats
import numpy as np

# Daily stock returns (%) for a tech company
returns = [0.5, -0.3, 1.2, -2.5, 0.8, 3.1, -1.8, 0.2, 4.0, -3.2]
kurt = stats.kurtosis(returns)

print(f"Kurtosis of Returns: {kurt:.2f}")

We analyze daily stock returns, a common financial dataset. The
returns list simulates percentage changes in stock price over 10
days. stats.kurtosis calculates the excess kurtosis (relative to
a normal distribution, where kurtosis = 0).

A kurtosis of 0.73 indicates heavier tails than a normal distribution,
suggesting more extreme price swings—useful for risk assessment in finance.

$ ./kurtosis.py
Kurtosis of Returns: 0.73

## SciPy Stats Skew

The **skew** measures the asymmetry of a distribution. Positive
skew means a longer right tail (e.g., income data), while negative skew
indicates a longer left tail (e.g., time to failure).

skew.py
  

#!/usr/bin/python

from scipy import stats
import numpy as np

# Annual incomes (thousands USD) in a small town
incomes = [25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 60, 80, 120, 200]
skewness = stats.skew(incomes)

print(f"Skewness of Incomes: {skewness:.2f}")

The incomes list represents annual earnings, typical of economic
data with a few high earners. stats.skew computes the skewness.
A positive value (1.46) confirms a right-skewed distribution, common in income
studies.

This helps economists understand wealth distribution and identify inequality
trends in the population.

$ ./skew.py
Skewness of Incomes: 1.46

## SciPy Stats Find Repeats

The **find_repeats** function identifies repeated values in an
array and their counts, useful for spotting patterns or anomalies in discrete
data.

find_repeats.py
  

#!/usr/bin/python

from scipy import stats
import numpy as np

# Customer purchase counts in a week
purchases = [1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 1, 2, 5, 1, 3]
repeats = stats.find_repeats(purchases)

print(f"Repeated Values: {repeats.values}")
print(f"Counts: {repeats.counts}")

The purchases array tracks how many items each customer bought.
stats.find_repeats returns a FindRepeatsResult
object with values (repeated numbers) and counts
(how often they repeat).

Here, 1 and 2 appear multiple times (3 and 3), indicating frequent small
purchases. This is valuable for retail analysis to optimize inventory or
promotions.

$ ./find_repeats.py
Repeated Values: [1. 2. 3.]
Counts: [3 3 2]

## SciPy Stats Describe

The **describe** function provides a summary of a dataset,
including count, mean, variance, skew, kurtosis, and min/max, offering a quick
overview.

describe.py
  

#!/usr/bin/python

from scipy import stats
import numpy as np

# Patient wait times (minutes) in a clinic
wait_times = [10, 15, 12, 20, 25, 18, 30, 22, 35, 40]
summary = stats.describe(wait_times)

print(f"Number of Observations: {summary.nobs}")
print(f"Mean: {summary.mean:.2f} minutes")
print(f"Variance: {summary.variance:.2f} min²")
print(f"Skewness: {summary.skewness:.2f}")
print(f"Kurtosis: {summary.kurtosis:.2f}")
print(f"Min: {summary.minmax[0]}, Max: {summary.minmax[1]}")

The wait_times list simulates patient wait times in a healthcare
setting. stats.describe returns a DescribeResult
object with key statistics, accessed via attributes like nobs
(count) and mean.

The summary shows a mean of 22.7 minutes, slight positive skew (0.47), and
negative kurtosis (-0.73), suggesting a flatter distribution. This helps
clinics assess service efficiency and patient experience.

$ ./describe.py
Number of Observations: 10
Mean: 22.70 minutes
Variance: 90.46 min²
Skewness: 0.47
Kurtosis: -0.73
Min: 10, Max: 40

## SciPy Stats Linear Regression

**Linear regression** models the relationship between a dependent
variable and one or more independent variables, predicting trends.

regression.py
  

#!/usr/bin/python

from scipy import stats

ad_spend = [100, 200, 300, 400, 500]  # Ad budget ($)
sales = [1200, 1500, 1800, 2100, 2400] # Sales ($)
slope, intercept, r, p, se = stats.linregress(ad_spend, sales)

print(f"Slope: {slope:.2f}, Intercept: {intercept:.2f}")
print(f"R²: {r**2:.3f}, P-Value: {p:.3f}")

We model sales against ad spending. linregress returns slope,
intercept, correlation coefficient (r), p-value, and standard
error. The slope (2.4) suggests $1 in ads yields $2.40 in sales.

R² (1.0) indicates a perfect fit, though real data would show more variation.
This is useful for marketing analysis.

$ ./regression.py
Slope: 2.40, Intercept: 960.00
R²: 1.000, P-Value: 0.000

## Best Practices

- **Use NumPy Arrays:** Convert lists to arrays for efficiency.

- **Check Assumptions:** Verify normality for t-tests.

- **Interpret P-Values:** Small p (&lt;0.05) suggests significance.

- **Document Models:** Note distribution parameters used.
