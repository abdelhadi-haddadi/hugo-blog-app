# Java Instant Class

Last modified: April 16, 2025

 

The java.time.Instant class represents a point on the time-line in
UTC. It measures time from the epoch of 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z. Instant provides
nanosecond precision for representing timestamps.

Instant is immutable and thread-safe. It is commonly used for
logging events, storing timestamps in databases, and measuring time intervals.
The class works with machine time rather than human time concepts like days.

## Instant Class Overview

Instant provides methods to get current time, parse strings, and
perform calculations. Key operations include comparing instants, adding durations,
and converting to other time types. The class handles time in seconds and
nanoseconds.

public final class Instant implements Temporal, TemporalAdjuster, 
    Comparable&lt;Instant&gt;, Serializable {
    public static Instant now();
    public static Instant ofEpochSecond(long epochSecond);
    public static Instant ofEpochMilli(long epochMilli);
    public static Instant parse(CharSequence text);
    public long getEpochSecond();
    public int getNano();
    public boolean isAfter(Instant otherInstant);
    public boolean isBefore(Instant otherInstant);
    public Instant plus(long amountToAdd, TemporalUnit unit);
    public Instant minus(long amountToSubtract, TemporalUnit unit);
}

The code above shows key methods provided by Instant. These methods
allow creating, comparing, and manipulating instants. The class provides
precision up to nanoseconds while maintaining compatibility with older APIs.

## Creating Instant Objects

Instant objects can be created in several ways. The most common methods are
now for current time and factory methods for specific points in
time. Parsing from strings is also supported.

Main.java
  

package com.zetcode; 

import java.time.Instant;

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        
        // Current instant
        Instant now = Instant.now();
        System.out.println("Current instant: " + now);
        
        // From epoch seconds
        Instant epochSec = Instant.ofEpochSecond(1_000_000);
        System.out.println("From epoch seconds: " + epochSec);
        
        // From epoch milliseconds
        Instant epochMilli = Instant.ofEpochMilli(1_000_000_000L);
        System.out.println("From epoch milliseconds: " + epochMilli);
        
        // From string
        Instant parsed = Instant.parse("2025-01-01T00:00:00Z");
        System.out.println("Parsed from string: " + parsed);
    }
}

This example demonstrates different ways to create Instant objects. The output
shows timestamps in ISO-8601 format. The now method captures
the current moment with nanosecond precision where available.

## Getting Instant Components

An Instant can be decomposed into its epoch seconds and nanoseconds components.
These values represent time since 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z. The methods are useful
for interoperability with older APIs.

Main.java
  

package com.zetcode; 

import java.time.Instant;

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        Instant instant = Instant.now();
        
        // Get epoch seconds
        long seconds = instant.getEpochSecond();
        System.out.println("Epoch seconds: " + seconds);
        
        // Get nanoseconds fraction
        int nanos = instant.getNano();
        System.out.println("Nanoseconds: " + nanos);
        
        // Convert to milliseconds (losing nanos precision)
        long millis = instant.toEpochMilli();
        System.out.println("Epoch milliseconds: " + millis);
    }
}

This example shows how to extract components from an Instant. Note that
toEpochMilli loses nanosecond precision as it converts to
milliseconds. The epoch second and nanosecond together provide full precision.

## Comparing Instants

Instants can be compared to determine chronological order. The class provides
isBefore, isAfter, and compareTo methods.
These comparisons are essential for time-based logic in applications.

Main.java
  

package com.zetcode; 

import java.time.Instant;
import java.time.temporal.ChronoUnit;

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        Instant now = Instant.now();
        Instant later = now.plus(1, ChronoUnit.HOURS);
        Instant earlier = now.minus(30, ChronoUnit.MINUTES);
        
        System.out.println("Now is before later: " + now.isBefore(later));
        System.out.println("Now is after earlier: " + now.isAfter(earlier));
        System.out.println("Comparison result: " + now.compareTo(later));
        
        // Equality check
        Instant copy = Instant.ofEpochSecond(now.getEpochSecond(), now.getNano());
        System.out.println("Now equals copy: " + now.equals(copy));
    }
}

This example demonstrates various ways to compare Instant objects. The comparison
methods consider both seconds and nanoseconds components. Note that equality
requires both components to match exactly.

## Adding and Subtracting Time

Instant supports temporal arithmetic through plus and
minus methods. These operations are useful for calculating future
or past points in time. The class handles overflow and underflow automatically.

Main.java
  

package com.zetcode; 

import java.time.Instant;
import java.time.Duration;
import java.time.temporal.ChronoUnit;

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        Instant now = Instant.now();
        
        // Add using ChronoUnit
        Instant inOneHour = now.plus(1, ChronoUnit.HOURS);
        System.out.println("In one hour: " + inOneHour);
        
        // Subtract using Duration
        Instant thirtyMinsAgo = now.minus(Duration.ofMinutes(30));
        System.out.println("Thirty minutes ago: " + thirtyMinsAgo);
        
        // Add days (converted to seconds)
        Instant tomorrow = now.plus(1, ChronoUnit.DAYS);
        System.out.println("Tomorrow: " + tomorrow);
        
        // Mixed operations
        Instant complex = now.plus(2, ChronoUnit.HOURS)
                           .minus(15, ChronoUnit.MINUTES);
        System.out.println("Complex operation result: " + complex);
    }
}

This example shows various ways to perform temporal arithmetic with Instant.
Operations can use ChronoUnit constants or Duration objects. All calculations
are precise to nanoseconds and handle unit conversions automatically.

## Converting Between Time Types

Instant can be converted to and from other temporal types like ZonedDateTime.
These conversions are essential when working with time zones or human-readable
date representations.

Main.java
  

package com.zetcode; 

import java.time.Instant;
import java.time.LocalDateTime;
import java.time.ZoneId;
import java.time.ZonedDateTime;

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        Instant now = Instant.now();
        
        // Convert to ZonedDateTime
        ZonedDateTime zoned = now.atZone(ZoneId.of("America/New_York"));
        System.out.println("In New York: " + zoned);
        
        // Convert to LocalDateTime (loses timezone info)
        LocalDateTime local = LocalDateTime.ofInstant(now, ZoneId.systemDefault());
        System.out.println("Local date-time: " + local);
        
        // Convert back to Instant
        Instant back = zoned.toInstant();
        System.out.println("Back to instant: " + back);
        
        // Convert from LocalDateTime
        Instant fromLocal = LocalDateTime.now().atZone(ZoneId.systemDefault()).toInstant();
        System.out.println("From local date-time: " + fromLocal);
    }
}

This example demonstrates conversions between Instant and other temporal types.
Note that LocalDateTime lacks timezone information, so system default is used.
All conversions preserve the exact moment in time being represented.

## Measuring Time Intervals

Instant is often used to measure time intervals between events. The Duration
class works with Instant to provide precise time measurements with various units.

Main.java
  

package com.zetcode; 

import java.time.Instant;
import java.time.Duration;

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {

        Instant start = Instant.now();
        
        // Simulate work
        Thread.sleep(1500);
        
        Instant end = Instant.now();
        
        // Calculate duration
        Duration duration = Duration.between(start, end);
        System.out.println("Elapsed time: " + duration.toMillis() + " ms");
        System.out.println("In seconds: " + duration.getSeconds() + "." + 
            duration.getNano() / 1_000_000 + " seconds");
        
        // Create duration and add to instant
        Duration twoHours = Duration.ofHours(2);
        Instant future = start.plus(twoHours);
        System.out.println("Two hours later: " + future);
    }
}

This example shows how to measure time intervals using Instant and Duration.
The Duration.between method calculates precise time differences.
Durations can also be used to perform temporal arithmetic with Instants.
