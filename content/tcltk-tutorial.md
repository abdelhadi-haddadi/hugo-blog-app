## Tk

*Tk* is an open source, cross-platform widget toolkit that provides a 
library of basic elements for building a graphical user interface (GUI). 
The first public release of Tk was in 1991. There are bindings for several 
other languages including Ada, Perl, Ruby, Python or Common Lisp.
The Tk library is often referred with its main language as Tcl/Tk.
