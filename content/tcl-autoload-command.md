# Tcl auto_load Command

last modified April 3, 2025

The Tcl auto_load command is part of Tcl's auto-loading mechanism.
It automatically loads Tcl procedures when they are first called. This provides
on-demand package loading.

## Basic Definition

The auto_load command checks if a command exists and attempts to
load it if not found. It uses an index of available commands to locate and
load the required package.

Syntax: auto_load cmdName. The command returns 1 if it attempts to
load the command, 0 otherwise. It doesn't guarantee the command will be available.

## Basic auto_load Usage

This example shows the simplest usage of auto_load to attempt loading
a command.

basic_auto_load.tcl
  

if {[auto_load some_command]} {
    puts "Attempted to load some_command"
} else {
    puts "some_command not found in auto_load index"
}

This checks if some_command can be loaded automatically. The
auto_load command returns 1 if it finds and loads the command.

## Checking Command Existence

Combine auto_load with info commands to verify if a
command was successfully loaded.

auto_load_check.tcl
  

set cmdName "my_proc"
auto_load $cmdName
if {[info commands $cmdName] ne ""} {
    puts "$cmdName is now available"
} else {
    puts "Failed to load $cmdName"
}

This attempts to load my_proc and checks if it exists afterward.
The info commands verifies the command's availability.

## Loading Standard Library Commands

Many Tcl standard library commands use auto-loading. This example demonstrates
loading the file command.

auto_load_stdlib.tcl
  

if {![info commands file]} {
    auto_load file
    puts "Attempted to load file command"
}
file exists /tmp

This checks if the file command exists, attempts to load it if not,
then uses it. Most Tcl installations have core commands pre-loaded.

## Working with Custom Packages

For custom packages, you need to set up the auto_path and create proper package
index files.

auto_load_custom.tcl
  

lappend auto_path [file join $env(HOME) my_tcl_libs]
if {[auto_load my_custom_proc]} {
    my_custom_proc
} else {
    puts "Could not load my_custom_proc"
}

This adds a custom library directory to auto_path then attempts to
load a procedure from it. The procedure must be properly indexed in a
tclIndex file.

## Auto Loading with Namespaces

auto_load works with namespaced commands too. This example shows
how to load a namespaced command.

auto_load_namespace.tcl
  

if {[auto_load ::mylib::myfunc]} {
    puts "Loaded ::mylib::myfunc"
    ::mylib::myfunc
}

This attempts to load a command from the mylib namespace. The
package must be properly set up with namespace declarations in its index.

## Debugging Auto Loading

Use auto_qualify and auto_load_index to debug
auto-loading issues.

auto_load_debug.tcl
  

set cmd "my_command"
set qualified [auto_qualify $cmd ""]
puts "Looking for: $qualified"
parray auto_index

This shows how to check what commands are available for auto-loading. The
auto_qualify helps understand how Tcl will look for the command.

## Best Practices

- **Setup:** Ensure auto_path is properly configured.

- **Indexing:** Maintain accurate tclIndex files.

- **Namespaces:** Use namespaces to avoid conflicts.

- **Fallbacks:** Provide manual loading fallbacks.

- **Testing:** Test auto-loading in your environment.
