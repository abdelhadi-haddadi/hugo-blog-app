# Excel CHOOSE Function

last modified April 4, 2025

The CHOOSE function is a versatile lookup function in Excel that 
returns a value from a list based on a specified position. This tutorial 
provides a comprehensive guide to using the CHOOSE function with 
detailed examples. You'll learn basic syntax, practical applications, and 
advanced techniques to master this powerful Excel function.

## CHOOSE Function Basics

The CHOOSE function selects and returns a value from a list of 
arguments based on an index number. It can handle up to 254 values and is 
useful for creating dynamic formulas.

  
    Component
    Description
  
  
    Function Name
    CHOOSE
  
  
    Syntax
    =CHOOSE(index_num, value1, [value2], ...)
  
  
    Arguments
    Index number + 1-254 values
  
  
    Return Value
    Selected value from the list
  

This table breaks down the essential components of the CHOOSE
function. It shows the function name, basic syntax format, argument limits, and
return value characteristics.

## Basic CHOOSE Example

This example demonstrates the simplest use of the CHOOSE function with hard-coded 
values.

Basic CHOOSE formula
  

=CHOOSE(2, "Apple", "Banana", "Cherry")

This formula returns "Banana" because it's the second item in the list (index 2). 
The first argument is the position number, followed by the values to choose from.

## CHOOSE with Cell References

A more practical use of CHOOSE involves referencing cells for both 
the index and values. Here's an example with cell references.

  
    A
    B
    C
  
  
    2
    Red
    
  
  
    
    Green
    
  
  
    
    Blue
    
  
  
    
    
    =CHOOSE(A1, B1, B2, B3)
  

The table shows a simple spreadsheet with an index number in A1 and color values 
in B1:B3. The CHOOSE formula in C4 returns the color based on the index.

CHOOSE with cell references
  

=CHOOSE(A1, B1, B2, B3)

This formula uses the value in A1 (2) to select from B1 ("Red"), B2 ("Green"), 
and B3 ("Blue"). The result will be "Green". This demonstrates how CHOOSE can 
create dynamic outputs.

## CHOOSE with Ranges

CHOOSE can return entire ranges, which is useful for creating dynamic references 
in other formulas. This example shows this capability.

  
    A
    B
    C
  
  
    1
    Q1
    100
  
  
    
    Q2
    200
  
  
    
    Q3
    300
  
  
    
    
    =SUM(CHOOSE(A1, B1:C1, B2:C2, B3:C3))
  

This table demonstrates how CHOOSE can select different ranges based on an index. 
The formula in C4 sums either Q1, Q2, or Q3 data based on the value in A1.

CHOOSE with ranges
  

=SUM(CHOOSE(A1, B1:C1, B2:C2, B3:C3))

If A1 contains 2, this formula selects the range B2:C2 ("Q2" and 200) and sums 
it. Since "Q2" is text, it's ignored, returning 200. This technique is powerful 
for dynamic data analysis.

## CHOOSE with Nested Functions

CHOOSE can be nested with other functions to create complex logic. This example 
shows CHOOSE nested with WEEKDAY.

  
    A
    B
  
  
    5/15/2023
    
  
  
    
    =CHOOSE(WEEKDAY(A1), "Sun", "Mon", "Tue", "Wed", "Thu", "Fri", "Sat")
  

The table demonstrates using CHOOSE to convert a weekday number to a day name. 
The WEEKDAY function returns a number 1-7, which CHOOSE uses to select the 
correct day abbreviation.

CHOOSE with WEEKDAY
  

=CHOOSE(WEEKDAY(A1), "Sun", "Mon", "Tue", "Wed", "Thu", "Fri", "Sat")

For May 15, 2023 (a Monday), WEEKDAY returns 2, so CHOOSE returns "Mon". This 
combination is useful for creating user-friendly date displays without complex 
formatting.

## CHOOSE for Scenario Analysis

CHOOSE is excellent for scenario analysis where you need to switch between 
different calculation methods. This example demonstrates this application.

  
    A
    B
    C
  
  
    2
    1000
    
  
  
    
    
    =B1*CHOOSE(A1, 0.1, 0.15, 0.2)
  

This table shows how CHOOSE can select different percentage rates based on a 
scenario number. The formula in C2 calculates different commission rates 
depending on the value in A1.

CHOOSE for scenario rates
  

=B1*CHOOSE(A1, 0.1, 0.15, 0.2)

With A1=2 and B1=1000, this formula calculates 1000 * 0.15 = 150. This approach 
lets you easily switch between different calculation parameters without complex 
IF statements.

## CHOOSE with VLOOKUP Alternative

CHOOSE can create a simplified lookup table as an alternative to VLOOKUP for 
small datasets. This example shows this technique.

  
    A
    B
    C
  
  
    3
    
    
  
  
    
    
    =CHOOSE(A1, "Bronze", "Silver", "Gold", "Platinum")
  

The table demonstrates using CHOOSE as a simple lookup where numeric codes 
(1-4) correspond to membership levels. This is more efficient than VLOOKUP 
for small, static lists.

CHOOSE as simple lookup
  

=CHOOSE(A1, "Bronze", "Silver", "Gold", "Platinum")

When A1 contains 3, this formula returns "Gold". While limited to about 254 
items, this method is faster to set up than VLOOKUP for small, unchanging 
lookup tables.

The CHOOSE function is a versatile tool for creating dynamic 
formulas in Excel. From simple value selection to complex scenario analysis, 
CHOOSE offers elegant solutions. Mastering its various 
applications will significantly improve your spreadsheet efficiency. Remember 
that CHOOSE is limited to 254 values and requires numeric index 
positions starting from 1.
