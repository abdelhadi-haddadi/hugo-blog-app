# Groovy String Operations

last modified March 22, 2025

Groovy arms you with a vibrant toolkit for string handling, blending simplicity
with power. This tutorial dives into key string operations—concatenation,
interpolation, and manipulation—through practical, real-world examples that
make text wrangling a breeze.

## String Concatenation

In Groovy, strings snap together with the + operator or the
concat method, letting you build messages piece by piece.

StringConcatenation.groovy
  

def user = "Alice"
def action = "logged in"
def logEntry = user + " " + action

println logEntry

logEntry fuses user and action with a
space, crafting a basic log line. Think of this stitching together audit trails
in a system monitor—straightforward and reliable.

## String Interpolation

Groovy's ${} interpolation weaves variables right into strings,
making dynamic text as smooth as a conversation—no clunky glue required.

StringInterpolation.groovy
  

def name = "Bob"
def welcome = "Hi, ${name}, enjoy your stay!"

println welcome

welcome embeds name seamlessly, personalizing a
greeting. Picture this in a hotel app, tailoring check-in messages for guests
with zero fuss—elegant and readable.

## String Manipulation

Groovy dishes out handy methods like toUpperCase,
toLowerCase, and reverse to twist and tweak strings
to your liking.

StringManipulation.groovy
  

def title = "Sale Event"

println title.toUpperCase()
println title.toLowerCase()
println title.reverse()

title gets reshaped three ways—shouted, whispered, or flipped.
This could jazz up a promo banner, adjusting case for emphasis or creating a
quirky display twist in a marketing tool.

## String Length and Substrings

Groovy lets you measure strings with length and snip out chunks
with substring, perfect for dissecting text precisely.

StringLengthSubstring.groovy
  

def code = "ORDER12345"

println code.length()
println code.substring(5, 9)

code reveals its size and yields a numeric slice. Imagine parsing
an order ID in an e-commerce system, pulling out key digits for validation or
display—neat and tidy.

## String Splitting

The split method chops strings into arrays using a delimiter,
turning messy text into manageable pieces.

StringSplitting.groovy
  

def csvLine = "Alice,25,F"
def fields = csvLine.split(',')

fields.each { field -&gt;
    println field
}

csvLine splits into name, age, and gender fields. This mirrors
processing a CSV file in a data importer, breaking rows into actionable bits
with Groovy's each for easy iteration.

## String Replacement

Groovy's replace and replaceAll methods swap out
string parts, offering quick fixes or pattern-based overhauls.

StringReplacement.groovy
  

def feedback = "Service was good"

println feedback.replace("good", "great")
println feedback.replaceAll("e", "3")

feedback upgrades "good" to "great" or swaps "e" for "3". This
could tweak user reviews in a feedback app or mask text for a playful filter—two
sides of Groovy's replacement coin.

## String Padding

Groovy's padLeft and padRight align strings with
padding, handy for formatting fixed-width outputs.

StringPadding.groovy
  

def id = "42"
def paddedId = id.padLeft(5, "0")

println paddedId

paddedId pads "42" with zeros to five digits. This fits a ticket
system, ensuring IDs line up neatly in reports or displays—consistency made
simple.

## String Joining

Groovy's join fuses a list into a string with a delimiter,
flipping split for seamless assembly.

StringJoining.groovy
  

def tags = ["news", "tech", "groovy"]
def tagLine = tags.join(" | ")

println tagLine

tagLine glues tags with " | ", crafting a readable
list. Think blog post tags—joining keywords into a sleek, user-friendly string
for a sidebar or footer.

## String Matching with Regex

Groovy's regex support via =~ and findAll hunts
patterns, pulling matches or testing strings with finesse.

StringRegex.groovy
  

def text = "Contact: alice@site.com, bob@site.com"
def emails = text.findAll(/[\w\.-]+@[\w\.-]+/)

println emails

emails extracts email addresses with a regex pattern. This could
power a contact scraper, harvesting emails from text for a CRM tool—regex magic
at work.

## Best Practices for Working with Strings

**Favor Interpolation:** Opt for ${} over
+ to keep code crisp and clear, like a well-edited story.
**Guard Against Nulls:** Use the Elvis operator
?: to dodge null pitfalls—safety first!
**Tap Regex Power:** Lean on regular expressions for intricate
text surgery, slicing through complexity with precision.
**Mind Performance:** Watch out for heavy string ops in tight
loops—keep it lean for speed.
