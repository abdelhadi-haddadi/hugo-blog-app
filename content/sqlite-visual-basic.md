## SQLite &amp; Visual Basic

*SQLite* is an embedded relational database engine. It is a 
self-contained, serverless, zero-configuration and transactional SQL database 
engine. SQLite implements most of the SQL-92 standard for SQL. The SQLite 
engine is not a standalone process. Instead, it is statically or dynamically 
linked into the application. An SQLite database is a single ordinary disk 
file that can be located anywhere in the directory hierarchy.

*Visual Basic* is a modern, high-level, general-purpose, object-based 
programming language. It is the second most important language of the .NET 
framework. The main design goal of the language was to create an easy to use 
and learn programming language. It was derived from the classic BASIC language.
