# Python os.getppid Function

Last modified April 11, 2025

This comprehensive guide explores Python's os.getppid function,
which returns the parent process ID (PPID) of the current process. We'll cover
process hierarchy, practical examples, and related system calls.

## Basic Definitions

The os.getppid function returns the process ID of the parent
process that created the current process. Every process (except init) has
a parent process in Unix-like systems.

Key points: returns integer PPID, available on Unix/Windows, related to
os.getpid (current PID). Parent process can terminate while
child continues running (orphan process).

## Basic Usage Example

This simple example demonstrates how to get both the current process ID
and its parent process ID using os.getpid and os.getppid.

basic_usage.py
  

import os

print(f"Current process ID (PID): {os.getpid()}")
print(f"Parent process ID (PPID): {os.getppid()}")

When run directly, this will show the Python interpreter's PID and the
terminal/shell's PID that launched it. The output will vary each run.

The parent process is typically the shell or process that executed the
Python script. This relationship forms a process tree hierarchy.

## Process Hierarchy Demonstration

This example creates a child process to show how parent-child relationships
work and how PPID changes in child processes.

process_hierarchy.py
  

import os
import time

def child_process():
    print(f"Child PID: {os.getpid()}")
    print(f"Child's PPID: {os.getppid()}")
    time.sleep(2)

def parent_process():
    print(f"Parent PID: {os.getpid()}")
    print(f"Parent's PPID: {os.getppid()}")
    
    pid = os.fork()
    if pid == 0:  # Child process
        child_process()
    else:  # Parent process
        print(f"Created child with PID: {pid}")
        time.sleep(3)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    parent_process()

This Unix-specific example uses os.fork to create a child
process. The child reports its PID and PPID (which is the parent's PID).

Note that Windows doesn't support os.fork - this example
works only on Unix-like systems. The sleep calls prevent premature exit.

## Orphan Process Detection

This example demonstrates how to detect when a parent process dies,
making the child an orphan (adopted by init, PPID becomes 1).

orphan_process.py
  

import os
import time

def child_process():
    original_ppid = os.getppid()
    print(f"Child started with PPID: {original_ppid}")
    
    while True:
        current_ppid = os.getppid()
        if current_ppid != original_ppid:
            print(f"Parent died! New PPID: {current_ppid}")
            break
        time.sleep(1)

def parent_process():
    print(f"Parent PID: {os.getpid()}")
    pid = os.fork()
    if pid == 0:  # Child
        child_process()
    else:  # Parent
        time.sleep(2)
        print("Parent exiting")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    parent_process()

The child process continuously checks its PPID. When the parent exits,
the child's PPID changes to 1 (init process on Unix systems).

This demonstrates how processes can outlive their parents and how the
system reassigns orphan processes to maintain process hierarchy.

## Cross-Platform Process Creation

This example shows a cross-platform way to create processes and examine
the parent-child relationship using os.getppid.

cross_platform.py
  

import os
import sys
import time
from multiprocessing import Process

def child_task():
    print(f"Child PID: {os.getpid()}")
    print(f"Child's PPID: {os.getppid()}")
    time.sleep(2)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    print(f"Parent PID: {os.getpid()}")
    
    # Cross-platform process creation
    p = Process(target=child_task)
    p.start()
    
    print(f"Created child with PID: {p.pid}")
    p.join()
    print("Parent exiting")

Using multiprocessing.Process instead of os.fork
makes this work on both Unix and Windows systems while maintaining the
parent-child relationship.

The child process reports its PID and PPID, showing the relationship to
the parent process that created it.

## Process Tree Visualization

This example builds a simple process tree by recursively creating child
processes and tracking parent-child relationships.

process_tree.py
  

import os
import time
from multiprocessing import Process

def process_node(name, depth):
    if depth &lt;= 0:
        return
        
    print(f"{'  '*(3-depth)}Node {name}: PID={os.getpid()}, PPID={os.getppid()}")
    
    children = []
    for i in range(2):  # Create 2 child processes
        p = Process(target=process_node, args=(f"{name}.{i}", depth-1))
        children.append(p)
        p.start()
    
    time.sleep(1)  # Wait for children to print their info
    
    for p in children:
        p.join()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    process_node("root", 3)

This creates a binary tree of processes 3 levels deep, printing each
process's PID and PPID to visualize the hierarchy.

The indentation in the output helps visualize the tree structure. Each
process knows its parent through os.getppid.

## Daemon Process Example

This example demonstrates how daemon processes maintain their PPID
relationship and how it differs from regular processes.

daemon_process.py
  

import os
import time
from multiprocessing import Process

def daemon_task():
    print(f"Daemon PID: {os.getpid()}, PPID: {os.getppid()}")
    while True:
        print(f"Daemon running (PPID: {os.getppid()})")
        time.sleep(1)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    print(f"Main PID: {os.getpid()}")
    d = Process(target=daemon_task, daemon=True)
    d.start()
    
    print(f"Created daemon with PID: {d.pid}")
    time.sleep(3)
    print("Main process exiting (daemon will terminate)")

Daemon processes are designed to terminate when their parent exits.
This example shows the PPID relationship before and during execution.

Unlike the orphan process example, daemons don't get reassigned to
init - they terminate when their parent process exits.

## Security Considerations

- **Process spoofing:** PPID can potentially be spoofed in some cases

- **Race conditions:** Parent may exit between PPID check and use

- **Cross-platform:** Behavior consistent but implementation differs

- **Orphan processes:** Need special handling if parent dies

- **Privilege escalation:** Inherited privileges from parent process

## Best Practices

- **Check return value:** Always handle potential errors

- **Consider alternatives:** For complex hierarchies, use process managers

- **Document assumptions:** Clearly note parent process requirements

- **Handle parent death:** Implement logic for orphan scenarios

- **Cross-platform testing:** Verify behavior on all target systems
