# Python os.readv Function

Last modified April 11, 2025

This comprehensive guide explores Python's os.readv function,
which performs scatter reads from a file descriptor into multiple buffers.
We'll cover its Unix origins, performance benefits, and practical examples.

## Basic Definitions

The os.readv function reads data from a file descriptor into
multiple buffers in a single system call. This is known as scatter or
vectorized I/O.

Key parameters: fd (file descriptor), buffers (sequence of writable buffers).
Returns total bytes read. Requires Unix-like systems with readv() syscall.

## Basic readv Example

This example demonstrates the simplest use of os.readv to read
data into two separate buffers from a file. We first write some test data.

basic_readv.py
  

import os

# Create test file
with open("test.dat", "wb") as f:
    f.write(b"HelloWorldPythonReadv")

# Open file and prepare buffers
fd = os.open("test.dat", os.O_RDONLY)
buf1 = bytearray(5)  # First 5 bytes
buf2 = bytearray(10) # Next 10 bytes

# Perform scatter read
buffers = [buf1, buf2]
bytes_read = os.readv(fd, buffers)

print(f"Total bytes read: {bytes_read}")
print(f"Buffer 1: {buf1.decode()}")
print(f"Buffer 2: {buf2.decode()}")

os.close(fd)

This example writes data to a file, then reads it back into two separate
buffers. The first buffer gets 5 bytes, the second gets 10 bytes.

The os.readv call fills both buffers in one operation, which
is more efficient than multiple read calls.

## Reading into Multiple Buffers

os.readv can read into any number of buffers. This example shows
reading into three buffers with different sizes from a binary file.

multi_buffer_read.py
  

import os

# Generate binary data (24 bytes)
data = bytes(range(24))
with open("data.bin", "wb") as f:
    f.write(data)

fd = os.open("data.bin", os.O_RDONLY)

# Three buffers of different sizes
buf1 = bytearray(8)  # First 8 bytes
buf2 = bytearray(12) # Next 12 bytes
buf3 = bytearray(4)  # Final 4 bytes

buffers = [buf1, buf2, buf3]
bytes_read = os.readv(fd, buffers)

print(f"Read {bytes_read} bytes total")
print(f"Buffer 1: {list(buf1)}")
print(f"Buffer 2: {list(buf2)}")
print(f"Buffer 3: {list(buf3)}")

os.close(fd)

This creates a binary file with 24 bytes (0-23), then reads it into three
buffers of different sizes. The output shows the byte values in each buffer.

The total bytes read will be the sum of buffer sizes unless EOF is reached.

## Partial Reads with readv

When the file is smaller than the total buffer capacity, os.readv
performs a partial read. This example demonstrates handling such cases.

partial_read.py
  

import os

# Create small file (10 bytes)
with open("small.dat", "wb") as f:
    f.write(b"ShortFile")

fd = os.open("small.dat", os.O_RDONLY)

# Buffers that total more than file size
buf1 = bytearray(6)
buf2 = bytearray(6)
buf3 = bytearray(6)

buffers = [buf1, buf2, buf3]
bytes_read = os.readv(fd, buffers)

print(f"Read {bytes_read} bytes (file has 10 bytes)")
print(f"Buffer 1: {buf1.decode()}")
print(f"Buffer 2: {buf2.decode()}")
print(f"Buffer 3: {buf3.decode()}")  # Will be empty

os.close(fd)

This example shows what happens when reading from a small file into larger
buffers. Only the first buffers get filled, and the total bytes read matches
the file size.

The third buffer remains empty since the file content fits in the first two.

## Reading from Non-Seekable Files

os.readv works with non-seekable files like pipes and sockets.
This example reads from a pipe into multiple buffers.

pipe_readv.py
  

import os

# Create pipe
r, w = os.pipe()

# Write data to pipe
os.write(w, b"PipeDataForReadvExample")

# Prepare buffers
buf1 = bytearray(8)
buf2 = bytearray(12)

# Read from pipe
buffers = [buf1, buf2]
bytes_read = os.readv(r, buffers)

print(f"Read {bytes_read} bytes from pipe")
print(f"Buffer 1: {buf1.decode()}")
print(f"Buffer 2: {buf2.decode()}")

os.close(r)
os.close(w)

This creates a pipe, writes data to it, then reads using os.readv.
The same approach works with sockets and other non-seekable file descriptors.

For network programming, readv can efficiently gather incoming data into
pre-allocated buffers.

## Performance Comparison

This example compares os.readv with multiple os.read
calls to demonstrate the performance benefit of vectorized I/O.

performance_test.py
  

import os
import time

# Create large test file (1MB)
data = os.urandom(1024 * 1024)
with open("large.dat", "wb") as f:
    f.write(data)

def test_readv():
    fd = os.open("large.dat", os.O_RDONLY)
    buf1 = bytearray(512 * 1024)
    buf2 = bytearray(512 * 1024)
    os.readv(fd, [buf1, buf2])
    os.close(fd)

def test_multiple_read():
    fd = os.open("large.dat", os.O_RDONLY)
    buf1 = bytearray(512 * 1024)
    buf2 = bytearray(512 * 1024)
    os.read(fd, buf1)
    os.read(fd, buf2)
    os.close(fd)

# Time readv
start = time.time()
for _ in range(100):
    test_readv()
readv_time = time.time() - start

# Time multiple reads
start = time.time()
for _ in range(100):
    test_multiple_read()
read_time = time.time() - start

print(f"readv time: {readv_time:.3f}s")
print(f"Multiple read time: {read_time:.3f}s")
print(f"Ratio: {read_time/readv_time:.1f}x")

This benchmark creates a 1MB file and reads it 100 times using both methods.
os.readv typically shows better performance due to fewer syscalls.

The exact speedup depends on system and file size, but vectorized I/O is
generally more efficient for scattered reads.

## Error Handling with readv

This example demonstrates proper error handling when using os.readv,
including handling partial reads and system errors.

error_handling.py
  

import os
import errno

try:
    # Try reading from invalid FD
    buf = bytearray(10)
    os.readv(999, [buf])
except OSError as e:
    if e.errno == errno.EBADF:
        print("Error: Bad file descriptor")
    else:
        print(f"OS error: {e}")

# Handle partial read
try:
    fd = os.open("empty.dat", os.O_CREAT | os.O_RDONLY)
    buf1 = bytearray(10)
    buf2 = bytearray(10)
    bytes_read = os.readv(fd, [buf1, buf2])
    print(f"Read {bytes_read} bytes from empty file")
    os.close(fd)
except OSError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
finally:
    if 'fd' in locals():
        os.close(fd)

The first part attempts to read from an invalid file descriptor, showing how
to handle specific errors. The second part demonstrates reading from an empty
file.

Proper error handling is crucial when working with low-level file operations
as many things can go wrong.

## Advanced: Memoryview with readv

For maximum efficiency, os.readv can work with memoryview objects
to avoid unnecessary copies. This example shows the optimized approach.

memoryview_readv.py
  

import os

# Create test file
data = b"MemoryViewExampleData"
with open("memview.dat", "wb") as f:
    f.write(data)

fd = os.open("memview.dat", os.O_RDONLY)

# Allocate memory and create memoryviews
buffer = bytearray(20)
mv1 = memoryview(buffer)[0:10]  # First 10 bytes
mv2 = memoryview(buffer)[10:20] # Next 10 bytes

# Read into memoryviews
bytes_read = os.readv(fd, [mv1, mv2])

print(f"Read {bytes_read} bytes")
print(f"Full buffer: {buffer.decode()}")
print(f"View 1: {mv1.tobytes().decode()}")
print(f"View 2: {mv2.tobytes().decode()}")

os.close(fd)

This example allocates a single buffer, then creates two memoryview objects
that reference portions of it. os.readv writes directly into
these views.

Using memoryviews avoids extra memory allocations and copies, which is
important for high-performance applications.

## Performance Considerations

- **Fewer syscalls:** readv combines multiple reads into one

- **Buffer management:** Pre-allocation reduces overhead

- **Memory efficiency:** Memoryviews prevent copies

- **Alignment:** Proper buffer alignment improves performance

- **Kernel bypass:** Some systems optimize vectorized I/O

## Best Practices

- **Buffer sizing:** Size buffers according to expected data

- **Error handling:** Always check return values and errors

- **Resource cleanup:** Use try/finally for file descriptors

- **Portability:** Check system support (mainly Unix)

- **Benchmark:** Test performance gains for your use case
