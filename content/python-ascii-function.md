# Python ascii Function

Last modified April 11, 2025

This comprehensive guide explores Python's ascii function, which
returns a string containing a printable representation of an object. We'll cover
string conversion, non-ASCII handling, and practical examples of ASCII escape
sequences.

## Basic Definitions

The ascii function returns a string containing a printable
representation of an object, with non-ASCII characters escaped. It works
similarly to repr but escapes non-ASCII characters.

Key characteristics: converts any object to its ASCII representation, escapes
non-ASCII characters using \x, \u or \U escapes, and always returns a string.
It's useful for debugging and serialization.

## Basic String Conversion

Here's simple usage showing how ascii handles ASCII and non-ASCII
strings differently from repr and str.

basic_ascii.py
  

# ASCII string
print(ascii("hello"))      # 'hello'

# Non-ASCII string
print(ascii("h√©ll√∂"))      # 'h\xe9ll\xf6'

# Comparison with repr
print(repr("h√©ll√∂"))       # 'h√©ll√∂'
print(str("h√©ll√∂"))        # h√©ll√∂

This example shows ascii converting strings to ASCII-only
representation. Non-ASCII characters are escaped using \x sequences.

The difference from repr is clear - repr preserves
the original characters while ascii escapes them.

## Non-ASCII Characters Handling

This example demonstrates how ascii handles various non-ASCII
characters from different Unicode ranges.

non_ascii.py
  

# Latin-1 Supplement (√©)
print(ascii("caf√©"))       # 'caf\xe9'

# Greek (œÄ)
print(ascii("œÄr¬≤"))        # '\u03c0r\xb2'

# Emoji (üòä)
print(ascii("Hello üòä"))   # 'Hello \U0001f60a'

# Chinese (‰Ω†Â•Ω)
print(ascii("‰Ω†Â•Ω"))       # '\u4f60\u597d'

The function escapes characters differently based on their Unicode code point.
Latin-1 uses \x, BMP uses \u, and higher planes use \U.

This behavior ensures the output string contains only ASCII characters while
preserving all information through escape sequences.

## Custom Objects with __repr__

ascii works with custom objects by calling their __repr__
method and then escaping the result. This example shows the behavior.

custom_ascii.py
  

class Person:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
    
    def __repr__(self):
        return f"Person({self.name})"

p1 = Person("Alice")
p2 = Person("√Ålice")

print(ascii(p1))  # 'Person(Alice)'
print(ascii(p2))  # 'Person(\xc1lice)'

The Person class implements __repr__. When we call ascii
on instances, it first gets the representation string then escapes non-ASCII.

This shows how ascii can be used with custom objects while
maintaining ASCII-only output.

## Container Types

When used with containers like lists or dictionaries, ascii
escapes non-ASCII characters in all contained elements.

containers.py
  

data = [
    "caf√©",
    {"key": "v√§lue"},
    (1, "œÄ"),
    {"Œ±", "Œ≤"}
]

print(ascii(data))
# ['caf\xe9', {'key': 'v\xe4lue'}, (1, '\u03c0'), {'\u03b1', '\u03b2'}]

The example shows ascii recursively processing container elements.
Each string element gets escaped if it contains non-ASCII characters.

This behavior is useful when you need to serialize data while ensuring ASCII
output, such as for certain network protocols.

## Error Handling

The ascii function doesn't raise errors for any input type as it
relies on the object's __repr__ method.

errors.py
  

class BadRepr:
    def __repr__(self):
        return "Bad: caf√©"

print(ascii(BadRepr()))  # 'Bad: caf\xe9'

print(ascii(123))       # '123'
print(ascii([1, 2, 3])) # '[1, 2, 3]'
print(ascii(None))      # 'None'

These examples demonstrate ascii's behavior with different types.
It first gets the string representation then escapes non-ASCII characters.

Even with a custom __repr__ that returns non-ASCII, ascii
will escape those characters in the final output.

## Best Practices

- **Use for debugging:** When you need ASCII-only output for non-ASCII data

- **Prefer repr:** When you want to preserve original characters

- **Implement __repr__:** For custom objects to control ASCII output

- **Consider encode:** When you need bytes instead of escaped strings

- **Document usage:** Clearly indicate when ASCII output is required
