# JWT Testing

last modified April 4, 2025

## Definition of JWT Testing

JWT (JSON Web Token) testing is a specialized security assessment method focused
on evaluating the implementation and usage of JWTs in applications. It involves
systematically examining how tokens are generated, transmitted, validated, and
stored to identify potential security vulnerabilities. JWT testing ensures that
authentication mechanisms using these tokens are robust against common attacks
like tampering, replay, or information leakage. This process typically includes
analyzing token structure, signature verification, expiration handling, and
claims validation. By thoroughly testing JWTs, organizations can prevent
unauthorized access and maintain secure authentication flows in their systems.

JSON Web Tokens are an open standard (RFC 7519) that defines a compact,
self-contained way to securely transmit information between parties. They consist
of three parts: header, payload, and signature, each Base64Url encoded and
separated by dots. JWT testing specifically examines whether implementations
correctly follow the specification and security best practices. Unlike general
API testing, it focuses on the unique cryptographic and structural aspects of
JWT-based authentication systems.

## Broader Context of JWT Testing

JWT testing plays a critical role in modern application security, particularly in
microservices architectures and single-page applications (SPAs). As JWTs have
become the de facto standard for stateless authentication, their proper
implementation is essential for maintaining system security. This testing fits
into broader security assessment frameworks like OWASP's Application Security
Verification Standard (ASVS) and Web Security Testing Guide (WSTG). It
complements other security testing methods such as OAuth testing, session
management testing, and general API security assessments.

In the software development lifecycle, JWT testing should occur during both
development (as part of secure coding practices) and quality assurance phases.
It's particularly important in CI/CD pipelines where automated JWT validation
tests can catch implementation flaws before deployment. With the rise of
zero-trust architectures, thorough JWT testing helps organizations verify their
identity and access management systems meet security requirements. It also helps
comply with regulations like GDPR and HIPAA that mandate proper authentication
controls.

## Characteristics of JWT Testing

**Focuses on cryptographic validation** - Verifies proper
signature algorithms and key management practices are implemented.
**Examines token structure** - Checks for correct encoding and
proper separation of header, payload, and signature components.
**Tests claim validation** - Ensures applications properly verify
standard claims like 'exp', 'nbf', and 'iss' as well as custom claims.
**Assesses storage and transmission security** - Evaluates how
tokens are stored client-side and transmitted between parties.
**Identifies common vulnerabilities** - Detects issues like
algorithm confusion, weak secrets, or missing validations.
**Combines manual and automated approaches** - Uses specialized
tools alongside expert analysis for comprehensive coverage.

## Types of JWT Testing

JWT testing encompasses various approaches depending on the testing context,
resources available, and specific security concerns. Different types of JWT
testing serve distinct purposes in the software development and security
assessment process. Some focus on functional correctness while others emphasize
security robustness. The choice of testing method often depends on the
application's risk profile, compliance requirements, and available tooling.

From manual penetration testing to automated scanning in CI pipelines, each JWT
testing type offers unique advantages. Some methods are better suited for
discovery phases while others excel at deep vulnerability analysis.
Understanding these variations helps security teams implement a balanced testing
strategy that covers all critical aspects of JWT security. Below we outline the
primary JWT testing methodologies along with their key characteristics and use
cases.

Type
Description

Manual Security Testing
In-depth examination by security experts using specialized tools to
manipulate JWTs and test application responses. This approach finds complex
vulnerabilities that automated tools might miss.

Automated Scanning
Uses specialized JWT testing tools to automatically detect common
vulnerabilities like weak algorithms, expired tokens, or missing validations.
Ideal for CI/CD integration.

Penetration Testing
Simulates real-world attacks against JWT implementations as part of broader
security assessments. Tests both technical flaws and logical vulnerabilities in
token handling.

Code Review
Examines application source code to identify insecure JWT library usage,
improper validation logic, or weak cryptographic implementations.

Fuzz Testing
Feeds malformed or unexpected JWT inputs to applications to uncover parsing
errors or validation bypass opportunities.

## Common JWT Vulnerabilities to Test For

JWT implementations are susceptible to several specific security vulnerabilities
that testing should systematically address. One critical area is algorithm
confusion attacks, where attackers exploit mismatches between a token's declared
algorithm and what the server expects to validate. Another common issue is
improper signature validation, where applications fail to properly verify token
signatures, allowing tampered tokens to be accepted. Testing should also check
for weak cryptographic algorithms like HS256 with guessable secrets or
none-algorithm acceptance.

Other important vulnerabilities include expired token acceptance (missing 'exp'
claim validation), replay attacks (missing 'jti' or nonce handling), and
information leakage through unencrypted sensitive payload data. Testing should
verify proper audience ('aud') claim validation to prevent token misuse across
different services. Additionally, tests should examine how refresh tokens are
handled and whether proper token revocation mechanisms exist. Comprehensive JWT
testing covers all these aspects to ensure a robust authentication system.

## JWT Testing Best Practices

- **Test all validation checks** - Verify expiration, issuer, audience, and other claim validations are properly implemented.

- **Check for algorithm confusion** - Ensure the application rejects tokens that declare unexpected algorithms.

- **Test with modified tokens** - Attempt to bypass security by altering signatures, claims, or headers.

- **Verify secret/key strength** - Check that cryptographic keys have sufficient entropy and are properly protected.

- **Test token storage** - Assess how tokens are stored client-side (e.g., HttpOnly cookies vs. local storage).

- **Automate repetitive tests** - Implement automated JWT validation checks in your CI/CD pipeline.

- **Use specialized tools** - Leverage JWT-specific testing tools like jwt_tool alongside general security scanners.
