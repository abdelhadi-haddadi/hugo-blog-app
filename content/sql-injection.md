# SQL Injection

last modified April 4, 2025

## Definition of SQL Injection

SQL Injection (SQLi) is a web security vulnerability that allows attackers to
interfere with database queries. It occurs when untrusted data is included in SQL
statements without proper validation or escaping. Attackers exploit this flaw to
execute malicious SQL commands that can read, modify, or delete sensitive data.
This vulnerability ranks among the top web application security risks due to its
potential impact and prevalence. SQL injection typically targets applications
that use relational databases like MySQL, Oracle, or SQL Server.

The core issue stems from mixing code and data in SQL queries, allowing attackers
to manipulate query logic. When user input is directly concatenated into SQL
statements, attackers can insert malicious SQL fragments. These fragments alter
the intended query structure, potentially granting unauthorized database access.
SQL injection has been a persistent threat since the early days of web
applications, remaining relevant despite modern security advancements.

## Broader Context of SQL Injection

SQL injection exists within the broader landscape of application security
vulnerabilities, classified as an injection attack. It shares characteristics
with other injection flaws like XSS and command injection but specifically
targets databases. In the OWASP Top 10 security risks, injection attacks
(primarily SQLi) consistently rank among the most critical threats to web
applications. The impact ranges from data breaches to complete system
compromise, depending on database permissions and application architecture.

Beyond technical consequences, SQL injection carries significant business risks,
including regulatory penalties and reputational damage. High-profile breaches
often involve SQLi, demonstrating its real-world danger. Modern frameworks and
ORMs have reduced but not eliminated SQLi risks, as improper usage can still
introduce vulnerabilities. Understanding SQL injection is essential for
developers, security professionals, and system administrators alike to build and
maintain secure applications.

## Characteristics of SQL Injection

**Database-specific syntax** - Attack patterns vary based on
the database management system (MySQL, SQL Server, etc.).
**Input vector diversity** - Can exploit forms, URLs, cookies,
or any user-controllable input.
**Impact severity variability** - Ranges from information
disclosure to full system compromise.
**Automation potential** - Attackers often use tools to
automate exploitation across multiple targets.
**Persistent threat** - Remains prevalent despite being one of
the oldest known web vulnerabilities.
**Preventable with proper coding** - Defensible through secure
coding practices and parameterized queries.

## Types of SQL Injection

SQL injection attacks can be categorized based on their techniques and the
information available to attackers. Each type requires different exploitation
methods and offers varying levels of access and control. Understanding these
variations helps security professionals implement targeted defenses and conduct
effective vulnerability assessments. The classification also assists in
prioritizing remediation efforts based on potential impact and exploit
complexity.

Some types focus on extracting data directly, while others infer information
through indirect means like error messages or timing differences. The database
system and application architecture influence which types are feasible in a given
scenario. Below we outline the primary SQL injection variants, their
characteristics, and typical exploitation methods to provide a comprehensive
understanding of this threat landscape.

Type
Description

Classic/Union-based
Uses UNION operators to combine legitimate queries with attacker-controlled
data extraction. Effective when results are directly visible in application
responses.

Error-based
Exploits database error messages to extract information. Useful when direct
output isn't available but errors reveal data or structure.

Blind (Boolean)
Inferences data through true/false conditions when no direct output or
errors are available. Slower but effective with persistent testing.

Blind (Time-based)
Uses time delays to infer information based on query execution time.
Particularly stealthy as it doesn't rely on visible output.

Out-of-band
Exfiltrates data through alternative channels like DNS or HTTP requests when
direct extraction isn't possible.

## Prevention Techniques

Preventing SQL injection requires a multi-layered approach combining secure
coding practices, architectural decisions, and runtime protections.
Parameterized queries (prepared statements) represent the most effective defense
by separating SQL code from data. This approach ensures user input is always
treated as data rather than executable code, regardless of its content. Stored
procedures can also help when implemented correctly, though they're not immune
to injection if dynamic SQL is used within them.

Input validation provides additional protection by rejecting clearly malicious
input before it reaches database queries. While not sufficient alone, it forms
part of a defense-in-depth strategy. ORM frameworks generally prevent SQLi when
used properly, but raw query methods can reintroduce risks. Web application
firewalls (WAFs) offer runtime protection by blocking known attack patterns,
though they shouldn't replace secure coding. Regular security testing, including
static analysis and penetration testing, helps identify and remediate
vulnerabilities before exploitation.

## Best Practices for Developers

**Use parameterized queries exclusively** - Never concatenate
user input directly into SQL statements.
**Implement principle of least privilege** - Database accounts
should have minimal necessary permissions.
**Validate and sanitize all user input** - Apply whitelist
validation for expected data formats.
**Use ORMs carefully** - Prefer safe methods and avoid raw
query features that bypass protections.
**Enable proper error handling** - Return generic error
messages without exposing database details.
**Conduct regular security testing** - Include SQL injection
checks in code reviews and penetration tests.
