# Golang Regexp.NumSubexp

last modified April 20, 2025

This tutorial explains how to use the Regexp.NumSubexp method in Go.
We'll cover subexpression counting and provide practical examples.

A regular expression is a sequence of characters that defines a
search pattern. It's used for pattern matching within strings.

The Regexp.NumSubexp method returns the number of parenthesized
subexpressions in the regular expression. This helps determine capture groups.

## Basic NumSubexp Example

The simplest use of NumSubexp counts subexpressions in a pattern.
Here we check a pattern with two capture groups.

basic_count.go
  

package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "regexp"
)

func main() {
    re := regexp.MustCompile(`(a)(b)`)
    count := re.NumSubexp()
    
    fmt.Println("Number of subexpressions:", count) // 2
}

The pattern has two parenthesized groups. NumSubexp returns 2,
matching the number of capture groups in the regex.

## Counting Date Components

This example shows how to count the capture groups in a date pattern.
It helps validate the structure before processing.

date_count.go
  

package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "regexp"
)

func main() {
    datePattern := `(\d{4})-(\d{2})-(\d{2})`
    re := regexp.MustCompile(datePattern)
    
    fmt.Println("Date components:", re.NumSubexp()) // 3
}

The date pattern has three capture groups for year, month, and day.
NumSubexp confirms we have three components to extract.

## No Subexpressions Case

When a pattern has no capture groups, NumSubexp returns zero.
This example demonstrates that behavior.

no_groups.go
  

package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "regexp"
)

func main() {
    re := regexp.MustCompile(`\d+`)
    count := re.NumSubexp()
    
    fmt.Println("Subexpressions:", count) // 0
}

The pattern matches digits but has no parentheses. NumSubexp
returns 0 as there are no capture groups to count.

## Nested Subexpressions

Nested capture groups are all counted by NumSubexp.
This example shows counting with nested patterns.

nested_groups.go
  

package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "regexp"
)

func main() {
    re := regexp.MustCompile(`((a)(b))(c)`)
    count := re.NumSubexp()
    
    fmt.Println("Total subexpressions:", count) // 4
}

The pattern has four capture groups, including nested ones.
NumSubexp counts all parenthesized expressions.

## Non-Capturing Groups

Non-capturing groups (using (?:...)) are not counted.
This example demonstrates the difference.

non_capturing.go
  

package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "regexp"
)

func main() {
    re := regexp.MustCompile(`(a)(?:b)(c)`)
    count := re.NumSubexp()
    
    fmt.Println("Capturing groups:", count) // 2
}

The pattern has two capturing groups and one non-capturing group.
NumSubexp only counts the capturing groups.

## Complex Pattern Analysis

For complex patterns, NumSubexp helps understand the structure.
This example counts groups in an email validation pattern.

complex_pattern.go
  

package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "regexp"
)

func main() {
    emailPattern := `^([a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+)@([a-zA-Z0-9.-]+)\.([a-zA-Z]{2,})$`
    re := regexp.MustCompile(emailPattern)
    
    fmt.Println("Email parts:", re.NumSubexp()) // 3
}

The email pattern has three capture groups for username, domain, and TLD.
NumSubexp helps verify the expected group count.

## Dynamic Pattern Handling

NumSubexp is useful when working with dynamic patterns.
This example shows how to handle unknown regex structures.

dynamic_pattern.go
  

package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "regexp"
)

func main() {
    patterns := []string{
        `(\w+) (\w+)`,
        `(\d{3})-(\d{3})-(\d{4})`,
        `[a-z]+`,
    }

    for _, p := range patterns {
        re := regexp.MustCompile(p)
        fmt.Printf("Pattern '%s' has %d subexpressions\n", p, re.NumSubexp())
    }
}

The code processes different patterns and reports their group counts.
This helps when working with user-provided or configurable regex patterns.
