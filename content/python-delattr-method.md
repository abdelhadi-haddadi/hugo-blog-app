# Python __delattr__ Method

Last modified April 8, 2025

This comprehensive guide explores Python's __delattr__ method, the
special method invoked during attribute deletion. We'll cover basic usage,
attribute protection, descriptor interaction, and practical examples.

## Basic Definitions

The __delattr__ method is called when an attribute deletion is
attempted on an object. It intercepts all del obj.attr operations.
This allows customization of attribute deletion behavior.

Key characteristics: it receives the attribute name as string, must call
super().__delattr__() for normal deletion, and can prevent
deletion of specific attributes. It works with __setattr__ and
__getattr__ for full attribute control.

## Basic __delattr__ Implementation

Here's a simple implementation showing how __delattr__ intercepts
attribute deletion. The method is called whenever del is used on
an instance attribute.

basic_delattr.py
  

class Person:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age
    
    def __delattr__(self, name):
        print(f"Deleting attribute: {name}")
        super().__delattr__(name)

p = Person("Alice", 30)
del p.age  # Triggers __delattr__
print(hasattr(p, 'age'))  # False

This example shows the basic interception of attribute deletion. The method
prints a message before delegating to the parent class's implementation for
actual deletion. Without calling super, the attribute wouldn't be deleted.

The super().__delattr__(name) call is crucial - it performs the
actual attribute removal from the instance's __dict__.

## Preventing Attribute Deletion

__delattr__ can protect certain attributes from being deleted by
raising an AttributeError when deletion is attempted.

protected_attrs.py
  

class ProtectedData:
    def __init__(self, data, protected=False):
        self.data = data
        self.protected = protected
    
    def __delattr__(self, name):
        if name == 'data' and self.protected:
            raise AttributeError("Cannot delete protected attribute 'data'")
        super().__delattr__(name)

pd = ProtectedData("secret", protected=True)
# del pd.data  # Raises AttributeError
del pd.protected  # Works fine

This class prevents deletion of the data attribute when the
protected flag is True. Attempting to delete it raises an
AttributeError with a custom message.

This pattern is useful for creating classes with critical attributes that
shouldn't be accidentally deleted during program execution.

## Logging Attribute Deletion

__delattr__ can log attribute deletions for debugging or auditing
purposes, tracking when and which attributes are removed.

logging_deletions.py
  

class LoggedDeletions:
    def __init__(self, **kwargs):
        for k, v in kwargs.items():
            setattr(self, k, v)
    
    def __delattr__(self, name):
        print(f"LOG: Deleting attribute '{name}' at {time.ctime()}")
        super().__delattr__(name)

import time
obj = LoggedDeletions(x=10, y=20)
del obj.x  # Logs the deletion
print(vars(obj))  # Shows remaining attributes

This implementation logs all attribute deletions with a timestamp. The actual
deletion still occurs via the parent class's implementation after logging.

Such logging can be valuable for debugging complex object lifecycles or
monitoring sensitive data handling in applications.

## Descriptor Interaction with __delattr__

When working with descriptors, __delattr__ allows custom behavior
when descriptor attributes are deleted, complementing __delete__.

descriptor_delattr.py
  

class Descriptor:
    def __delete__(self, instance):
        print("Descriptor __delete__ called")

class MyClass:
    desc = Descriptor()
    
    def __delattr__(self, name):
        print(f"MyClass __delattr__ for {name}")
        super().__delattr__(name)

obj = MyClass()
del obj.desc  # Calls both methods

This example shows the interaction between __delattr__ and
descriptor's __delete__. Both methods are called when deleting
a descriptor attribute, with __delattr__ called first.

The order is: __delattr__ intercepts the deletion, then the
descriptor's __delete__ is called if present, and finally the
actual attribute removal occurs.

## Dynamic Attribute Cleanup

__delattr__ can perform additional cleanup when attributes are
deleted, such as closing files or releasing resources associated with them.

cleanup_delattr.py
  

class ResourceHolder:
    def __init__(self):
        self.file = open('temp.txt', 'w')
        self.cache = {}
    
    def __delattr__(self, name):
        if name == 'file' and hasattr(self, 'file'):
            print("Closing file before deletion")
            getattr(self, 'file').close()
        super().__delattr__(name)

rh = ResourceHolder()
del rh.file  # Closes the file first
# File is now properly closed before deletion

This class ensures proper cleanup when file attributes are deleted. The
__delattr__ method checks if the attribute being deleted is a
file and closes it before proceeding with deletion.

This pattern helps prevent resource leaks when attributes holding resources
are deleted from instances.

## Best Practices

- **Always call super().__delattr__:** Unless intentionally blocking deletion

- **Be careful with recursion:** Avoid attribute access in __delattr__ that might recurse

- **Document protected attributes:** Clearly document which attributes cannot be deleted

- **Consider performance:** Complex __delattr__ logic can slow down attribute deletion

- **Use sparingly:** Only implement when you need special deletion behavior
