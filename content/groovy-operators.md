# Groovy Operators

last modified March 22, 2025

In this article, we explore operators in Groovy, special symbols that perform
operations on operands like numbers, strings, or booleans. Groovy offers a rich
set of operators—arithmetic, relational, logical, and unique ones like Elvis
and safe navigation—building on Java's foundation with added flexibility.
Understanding these enhances code efficiency and readability.

## Groovy Sign Operators

Sign operators + and - set or invert a value's sign,
affecting how numbers are interpreted in expressions. They're unary, acting on
a single operand, and are fundamental for numeric manipulation.

SignOperators.groovy
  

println(2)    // Positive by default
println(+2)   // Explicitly positive
println(-2)   // Negative

Here, 2 is positive implicitly, +2 explicitly marks it
so, and -2 inverts it to negative. These operators clarify intent
in calculations or when negating values dynamically.

SignOperatorsAdvanced.groovy
  

def x = 5
def y = -x
println(y)
println(-y)

This example assigns 5 to x, then uses - to create
y as -5. -y flips it back to 5, showing how sign
operators can transform variables in expressions.

## Groovy Assignment Operator

The assignment operator = binds a value to a variable, forming the
basis of data storage in Groovy. It's right-associative, meaning multiple
assignments chain from right to left.

AssignmentOperator.groovy
  

def x = 10
println(x)

def x = 10 assigns 10 to x. The def
keyword declares x dynamically, and = sets its value,
which is then printed. Simple yet essential for all programs.

AssignmentChain.groovy
  

def a = b = 7
println(a)
println(b)

Here, a = b = 7 chains assignments. Evaluated right-to-left,
b gets 7 first, then a receives b's
value (7). This demonstrates assignment's associativity in action.

## Groovy Concatenating Strings

The + operator doubles as a string concatenator in Groovy,
combining text operands into a single string. It's versatile, also working
with numbers by converting them to strings implicitly.

ConcatenateStrings.groovy
  

def str = "Hello, " + "Groovy!"
println(str)

"Hello, " + "Groovy!" merges two strings into "Hello, Groovy!".
The + operator seamlessly joins literals, creating a new string
stored in str, showcasing Groovy's string handling ease.

ConcatenateMixed.groovy
  

def num = 42
def msg = "Answer: " + num
println(msg)

"Answer: " + num mixes a string and an integer. Groovy converts
num (42) to a string, resulting in "Answer: 42". This implicit
coercion simplifies combining different types without extra casting.

## Groovy Increment and Decrement Operators

The ++ and -- operators adjust a variable's value by
1, either up or down. They can be prefix (++x) or postfix
(x++), affecting when the change is visible in expressions.

IncDec.groovy
  

def x = 5
x++           // Postfix increment
println(x)
x--           // Postfix decrement
println(x)

x++ increases x from 5 to 6 after its original value
is used, while x-- drops it back to 5. Postfix means the operation
applies after the current expression, altering x for the next use.

PrefixIncDec.groovy
  

def y = 10
println(++y)
println(--y)

++y increments y to 11 before printing, and
--y decrements it to 10 before the next print. Prefix operators
modify the value first, making the updated result immediate in the expression.

## Groovy Arithmetic Operators

Arithmetic operators—+, -, *,
/, and %—perform basic math on numbers. Groovy
handles division with decimals and modulus for remainders, aligning with
standard mathematical conventions.

ArithmeticOperators.groovy
  

def a = 10
def b = 3

println(a + b)
println(a - b)
println(a * b)
println(a / b)
println(a % b)

a + b adds to 13, a - b subtracts to 7,
a * b multiplies to 30, a / b divides to roughly 3.33
(a double), and a % b gives the remainder 1. These operators work
on integers or floats, with division yielding precise decimals.

ArithmeticMixed.groovy
  

def x = 15.5
def y = 4
println(x - y)
println(x % y)

x - y subtracts 4 from 15.5, yielding 11.5, a float.
x % y computes the remainder (15.5 = 3 * 4 + 3.5), showing 3.5.
This example highlights arithmetic with mixed numeric types, maintaining
precision.

## Groovy Boolean Operators

Boolean operators—&amp;&amp; (AND), || (OR), and
! (NOT)—manipulate true and false values
for logical conditions. They're short-circuiting, meaning evaluation stops once
the outcome is determined.

BooleanOperators.groovy
  

def x = true
def y = false

println(x &amp;&amp; y)
println(x || y)
println(!x)

x &amp;&amp; y requires both to be true (false here), x || y
needs one true (true), and !x inverts true to false. These form
the core of conditional logic, evaluating expressions efficiently due to
short-circuiting.

BooleanShortCircuit.groovy
  

def a = false
def b = { println("Skipped"); true }()
println(a &amp;&amp; b)

a &amp;&amp; b stops at false (a), skipping
b's closure execution (no "Skipped" printed). This demonstrates
short-circuiting: if the left operand decides the result, the right isn't
evaluated, saving computation.

## Groovy Relational Operators

Relational operators—==, !=, &lt;,
&gt;, &lt;=, &gt;=—compare values, returning
booleans. They work on numbers, strings, and more, with Groovy's lenient type
comparisons.

RelationalOperators.groovy
  

def a = 10
def b = 20

println(a == b)
println(a != b)
println(a &lt; b)
println(a &gt; b)
println(a &lt;= b)
println(a &gt;= b)

a == b checks equality (false), a != b inequality
(true), a &lt; b less than (true), and so on. These operators compare
a (10) and b (20), producing logical results for
control flow or decisions.

RelationalStrings.groovy
  

def s1 = "apple"
def s2 = "banana"
println(s1 &lt; s2)
println(s1 == "apple")

s1 &lt; s2 compares lexicographically ("apple" precedes "banana"),
returning true. s1 == "apple" confirms equality. Groovy's
relational operators handle strings via alphabetical order, making them
versatile beyond numbers.

## Groovy Elvis Operator

The Elvis operator ?: simplifies null checks, returning the
left-hand operand if non-null, otherwise the right-hand one. It's a concise
alternative to if-else for default values.

ElvisOperator.groovy
  

def name = null
def displayName = name ?: "Guest"
println(displayName)

name ?: "Guest" evaluates name (null), so it returns
"Guest". The Elvis operator shortens null handling, avoiding verbose checks
while ensuring a fallback, enhancing code brevity and safety.

ElvisNonNull.groovy
  

def user = "Alice"
def result = user ?: "Unknown"
println(result)

With user as "Alice" (non-null), user ?: "Unknown"
returns "Alice", skipping the default. This shows the operator's behavior with
valid values, only using the right operand when necessary.

## Groovy Safe Navigation Operator

The safe navigation operator ?. prevents
NullPointerException by returning null if the left operand is null
before accessing a property or method. It's a Groovy-specific safety net.

SafeNavigationOperator.groovy
  

def person = null
def name = person?.name
println(name)

person?.name checks person (null), so it returns null
instead of crashing. Without ?., this would throw an exception.
It's ideal for safely navigating object hierarchies that might be incomplete.

SafeNavigationValid.groovy
  

class User { String username = "Bob" }
def u = new User()
println(u?.username)

With u as a valid User object,
u?.username accesses "Bob" normally. The operator only intervenes
for null, making it transparent when objects exist, blending safety with
simplicity.

## Groovy Spread Operator

The spread operator *. applies a method or operation to each
element of a collection, returning a new list of results. It's a powerful
Groovy feature for bulk processing.

SpreadOperator.groovy
  

def numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]
def squares = numbers*.multiply(2)
println(squares)

numbers*.multiply(2) doubles each element in numbers,
producing [2, 4, 6, 8]. The spread operator invokes multiply on
every item, collecting results, simplifying iteration over collections.

SpreadString.groovy
  

def words = ["cat", "dog"]
def lengths = words*.length()
println(lengths)

words*.length() calls length() on each string,
returning [3, 3] for "cat" and "dog". This shows the operator's flexibility with
any method, not just numeric ones, enhancing collection operations.

## Groovy Operator Precedence

Operator precedence dictates the evaluation order in expressions, with higher
precedence operators (e.g., *) executed before lower ones (e.g.,
+). Groovy mirrors Java's rules, ensuring predictable math.

Precedence.groovy
  

def result = 3 + 5 * 2
println(result)

In 3 + 5 * 2, multiplication (5 * 2 = 10) precedes addition (3 +
10 = 13) due to higher precedence, yielding 13. Without this order, it'd be 16,
highlighting why precedence matters in complex expressions.

PrecedenceParens.groovy
  

def alt = (3 + 5) * 2
println(alt)

(3 + 5) * 2 uses parentheses (highest precedence) to force addition
first (8), then multiplication (16). This overrides natural precedence,
showing how to control evaluation order explicitly for desired outcomes.

## Groovy Associativity

Associativity governs the order of same-precedence operators. Most Groovy
operators are left-associative (left-to-right), but assignment and ternary
operators are right-associative (right-to-left), affecting chained operations.

Associativity.groovy
  

def a = 10
def b = 20
def c = 30

def result = a = b = c
println(result)

a = b = c assigns right-to-left: c (30) to
b, then b (30) to a, and a
to result. Right-associativity ensures the chain flows from the
rightmost value, unifying all variables at 30.

LeftAssociativity.groovy
  

def val = 20 - 5 - 3
println(val)

20 - 5 - 3 subtracts left-to-right due to left-associativity:
20 - 5 = 15, then 15 - 3 = 12. If right-associative, it'd be 20 - (5 - 3) = 18,
illustrating how associativity shapes results with equal-precedence operators.

## Groovy Ternary Operator

The ternary operator ?: condenses if-else logic into one line,
evaluating a condition to choose between two values. It's right-associative,
often used for concise assignments or returns.

TernaryOperator.groovy
  

def age = 20
def status = age &gt;= 18 ? "Adult" : "Minor"
println(status)

age &gt;= 18 ? "Adult" : "Minor" checks if age (20) is
at least 18 (true), returning "Adult". If false, it'd return "Minor". This
operator streamlines simple conditionals, reducing code verbosity.

TernaryNested.groovy
  

def score = 85
def grade = score &gt; 90 ? "A" : score &gt; 80 ? "B" : "C"
println(grade)

score &gt; 90 ? "A" : score &gt; 80 ? "B" : "C" nests ternaries.
Since 85 isn't &gt; 90 (false), it checks &gt; 80 (true), yielding "B". Right-
associativity resolves this as score &gt; 90 ? "A" : (score &gt; 80 ? "B" :
"C"), showing multi-level decision-making.

## Groovy Bitwise Operators

Bitwise operators—&amp; (AND), | (OR), ^
(XOR), ~ (NOT)—operate on integer bits, useful for low-level
manipulations like flags or masks. Results depend on binary representations.

BitwiseOperators.groovy
  

def a = 0b1010  // 10
def b = 0b1100  // 12

println(a &amp; b)
println(a | b)
println(a ^ b)
println(~a)

a &amp; b (1010 &amp; 1100 = 1000) yields 8, a | b (1010 |
1100 = 1110) 14, a ^ b (1010 ^ 1100 = 0110) 6, and ~a
inverts 1010 to -11 (two's complement). These manipulate bits directly,
offering precise control over binary data.

BitwiseShift.groovy
  

def x = 8       // 0b1000
println(x &lt;&lt; 1)
println(x &gt;&gt; 1)

x &lt;&lt; 1 shifts 8 (1000) left, adding a 0 (10000 = 16).
x &gt;&gt; 1 shifts right, dropping the last bit (0100 = 4). Shift
operators, also bitwise, multiply or divide by powers of 2, expanding bitwise
utility.
