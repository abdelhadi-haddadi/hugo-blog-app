# PHP chown Function

last modified April 3, 2025

The PHP chown function changes the owner of a file. It's useful for
managing file permissions and ownership in Unix-like systems.

## Basic Definition

The chown function attempts to change the owner of the specified
file to the given user. It requires appropriate permissions to work.

Syntax: chown(string $filename, string|int $user): bool. Returns
true on success or false on failure. The user can be specified by name or ID.

## Basic chown Example

This shows the simplest usage of chown to change file ownership.

basic_chown.php
  

&lt;?php

declare(strict_types=1);

$filename = '/var/www/html/testfile.txt';
$username = 'www-data';

if (chown($filename, $username)) {
    echo "Ownership changed to $username successfully.";
} else {
    echo "Failed to change ownership.";
}

This attempts to change the owner of testfile.txt to 'www-data'. The script must
be run with sufficient privileges (typically as root) for this to work.

## Changing Ownership by User ID

You can specify the user by numeric ID instead of username.

chown_by_id.php
  

&lt;?php

declare(strict_types=1);

$filename = '/var/www/html/config.ini';
$userid = 33; // Typically www-data's UID

if (chown($filename, $userid)) {
    echo "Ownership changed to UID $userid successfully.";
} else {
    echo "Failed to change ownership.";
}

This changes ownership using the numeric user ID. This can be more reliable as
it doesn't depend on username resolution. Check /etc/passwd for user IDs.

## Error Handling Example

Proper error handling is important when working with file permissions.

chown_error_handling.php
  

&lt;?php

declare(strict_types=1);

$filename = '/var/www/html/important.log';
$username = 'backup';

try {
    if (!file_exists($filename)) {
        throw new Exception("File does not exist.");
    }
    
    if (!is_writable($filename)) {
        throw new Exception("File is not writable.");
    }
    
    if (!chown($filename, $username)) {
        throw new Exception("Failed to change ownership.");
    }
    
    echo "Ownership changed successfully.";
} catch (Exception $e) {
    echo "Error: " . $e-&gt;getMessage();
}

This example includes comprehensive error checking before attempting to change
ownership. It verifies file existence, writability, and handles the chown result.

## Changing Ownership Recursively

This example shows how to change ownership for a directory and its contents.

recursive_chown.php
  

&lt;?php

declare(strict_types=1);

function recursiveChown(string $path, string $user): bool {
    if (!file_exists($path)) {
        return false;
    }
    
    if (!chown($path, $user)) {
        return false;
    }
    
    if (is_dir($path)) {
        $items = scandir($path);
        
        foreach ($items as $item) {
            if ($item != '.' &amp;&amp; $item != '..') {
                $fullpath = $path . DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR . $item;
                if (!recursiveChown($fullpath, $user)) {
                    return false;
                }
            }
        }
    }
    
    return true;
}

$directory = '/var/www/html/uploads';
$username = 'www-data';

if (recursiveChown($directory, $username)) {
    echo "Recursive ownership change successful.";
} else {
    echo "Failed to change ownership recursively.";
}

This recursive function changes ownership of all files and subdirectories. It
handles directories by scanning their contents and processing each item.

## Checking Current Ownership

Before changing ownership, you might want to check the current owner.

check_ownership.php
  

&lt;?php

declare(strict_types=1);

$filename = '/var/www/html/index.php';

$fileinfo = posix_getpwuid(fileowner($filename));
$current_owner = $fileinfo['name'];

echo "Current owner: $current_owner";

if ($current_owner != 'www-data') {
    if (chown($filename, 'www-data')) {
        echo "Ownership changed to www-data.";
    } else {
        echo "Failed to change ownership.";
    }
} else {
    echo "Ownership is already correct.";
}

This script first checks the current owner using fileowner and
posix_getpwuid. It only attempts to change ownership if needed.
This prevents unnecessary permission changes.

## Best Practices

- **Privileges:** Run as root or with sudo when needed.

- **Security:** Validate all input paths carefully.

- **Error Handling:** Always check return values.

- **Testing:** Test in a safe environment first.

- **Documentation:** Document ownership changes.
