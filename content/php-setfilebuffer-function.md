# PHP set_file_buffer Function

last modified April 3, 2025

The PHP set_file_buffer function sets the buffering for file writes.
It controls how much data is buffered before being written to disk.

## Basic Definition

The set_file_buffer function sets the buffer size for file writes.
It takes two parameters: the file pointer and the buffer size in bytes.

Syntax: set_file_buffer(resource $stream, int $size): int. It
returns 0 on success, or another value if buffering couldn't be set.

## Basic set_file_buffer Example

This shows how to set a buffer size for a file write operation.

basic_buffer.php
  

&lt;?php

declare(strict_types=1);

$file = fopen("output.txt", "w");
$bufferSize = 8192; // 8KB buffer

$result = set_file_buffer($file, $bufferSize);

if ($result === 0) {
    fwrite($file, str_repeat("A", 10000));
    fclose($file);
    echo "File written with 8KB buffer";
}

This sets an 8KB buffer for writing to output.txt. The buffer accumulates data
until it's full or the file is closed, then writes to disk.

## Disabling Buffering

Setting buffer size to 0 disables buffering, forcing immediate writes.

no_buffer.php
  

&lt;?php

declare(strict_types=1);

$file = fopen("immediate.txt", "w");
set_file_buffer($file, 0);

for ($i = 0; $i &lt; 10; $i++) {
    fwrite($file, "Line $i\n");
    sleep(1); // Each write appears immediately
}

fclose($file);
echo "File written with no buffering";

With buffering disabled, each write operation immediately hits the disk. This is
useful when you need data to persist right away.

## Large Buffer for Big Files

Larger buffers can improve performance when writing big files.

large_buffer.php
  

&lt;?php

declare(strict_types=1);

$file = fopen("bigfile.dat", "w");
set_file_buffer($file, 1048576); // 1MB buffer

for ($i = 0; $i &lt; 10000; $i++) {
    fwrite($file, str_repeat("DATA", 100));
}

fclose($file);
echo "Large file written with 1MB buffer";

A 1MB buffer reduces disk I/O operations when writing large amounts of data.
Fewer larger writes are generally more efficient than many small ones.

## Checking Buffer Setting

You can verify the buffer size was set correctly.

check_buffer.php
  

&lt;?php

declare(strict_types=1);

$file = fopen("test.txt", "w");
$desiredSize = 4096;

$result = set_file_buffer($file, $desiredSize);

if ($result === 0) {
    echo "Buffer set to $desiredSize bytes successfully";
} else {
    echo "Failed to set buffer size";
}

fclose($file);

This checks if the buffer was set successfully. A return value of 0 indicates
success, while other values mean the buffer couldn't be set as requested.

## Default Buffer Size

This example demonstrates the default buffer behavior.

default_buffer.php
  

&lt;?php

declare(strict_types=1);

$file1 = fopen("default1.txt", "w");
$file2 = fopen("default2.txt", "w");

// Don't set buffer on file1
set_file_buffer($file2, 0);

fwrite($file1, "Buffered write");
fwrite($file2, "Immediate write");

fclose($file1);
fclose($file2);

echo "Compare file modification times";

The first file uses PHP's default buffering, while the second has none. The
second file's content will appear on disk immediately after the write.

## Best Practices

- **Performance:** Larger buffers improve write performance.

- **Reliability:** Smaller buffers reduce data loss risk.

- **Defaults:** Understand your system's default buffer size.

- **Testing:** Benchmark different sizes for your use case.
