# Synthetic Monitoring

last modified April 4, 2025

## Definition of Synthetic Monitoring

Synthetic monitoring is a proactive approach to monitoring digital systems by
simulating user interactions with applications or services. It uses scripted
tests that mimic real user behavior to measure performance, availability, and
functionality from various locations and devices. Unlike real-user monitoring
(RUM), which captures actual user experiences, synthetic monitoring provides
controlled, repeatable tests that run at scheduled intervals. This method allows
teams to detect issues before real users encounter them, ensuring optimal
service quality. It's particularly valuable for critical business transactions
where uptime and performance directly impact revenue or customer satisfaction.

The term "synthetic" refers to the artificial nature of these tests, which are
carefully designed to represent typical user journeys. These tests can range from
simple HTTP pings to complex multi-step transactions across web and mobile
applications. By executing these predefined scenarios, organizations gain
insights into system health from an end-user perspective, regardless of actual
traffic levels. This makes synthetic monitoring especially useful for new
services with low user volumes or for testing during off-peak hours.

## Broader Context of Synthetic Monitoring

Synthetic monitoring plays a crucial role in modern IT operations and DevOps
practices as part of comprehensive application performance monitoring (APM)
strategies. It complements other monitoring approaches like real-user monitoring,
infrastructure monitoring, and log analysis to provide a 360-degree view of
system health. In today's digital-first world, where customer expectations for
speed and reliability are higher than ever, synthetic monitoring helps businesses
maintain competitive advantage by preventing performance degradation before it
affects users.

This methodology is particularly valuable for global organizations serving users
across different geographies, as it can simulate requests from various locations
worldwide. It's also integral to continuous delivery pipelines, where synthetic
tests can validate deployments automatically. By providing consistent benchmarks
over time, synthetic monitoring enables teams to track performance trends,
identify regressions, and measure the impact of optimizations. When combined
with alerting systems, it becomes a powerful tool for maintaining service level
objectives (SLOs) and agreements (SLAs).

## Characteristics of Synthetic Monitoring

**Proactive by nature** - Detects issues before real users
encounter them, enabling preventative maintenance.
**Consistent measurement** - Provides repeatable tests that
eliminate the variability of real user behavior for reliable benchmarking.
**Geographically distributed** - Can simulate requests from
multiple locations to assess global performance.
**Multi-protocol support** - Monitors various technologies
including HTTP/HTTPS, APIs, databases, and more.
**Scenario-based testing** - Allows modeling of complex user
journeys beyond simple page loads.
**Independent of live traffic** - Works even with no real users,
making it ideal for pre-launch testing.

## Types of Synthetic Monitoring

Synthetic monitoring encompasses several specialized approaches tailored to
different aspects of digital experience monitoring. Each type focuses on specific
layers of the application stack or particular user interaction patterns. The
choice of monitoring type depends on the critical components of your service and
the user behaviors you need to validate. Organizations often implement multiple
types to achieve comprehensive coverage of their digital properties.

From simple availability checks to complex business process validation, synthetic
monitoring scales to meet diverse requirements. The following table outlines the
primary types of synthetic monitoring, their purposes, and typical use cases.
Understanding these variations helps teams design monitoring strategies that align
with their specific operational needs and user expectations.

Type
Description

Availability Monitoring
Basic checks that verify whether a service or endpoint is reachable and
responding with expected status codes. Often uses simple HTTP/S requests.

API Monitoring
Validates the functionality and performance of application programming
interfaces by sending requests and verifying responses against schemas or
expected values.

Browser Monitoring
Simulates complete page loads in real browsers (often headless) to measure
rendering performance and detect front-end issues like broken resources.

Transaction Monitoring
Models multi-step user journeys (e.g., login → search → checkout) to validate
complete business processes and measure their end-to-end performance.

Single-Page Application Monitoring
Specialized monitoring for SPAs that tracks dynamic content loading and
client-side rendering performance.

## Benefits of Synthetic Monitoring

Synthetic monitoring offers numerous advantages for maintaining high-quality
digital experiences. It provides 24/7 visibility into application performance,
even during low-traffic periods when real-user data might be scarce. By
establishing performance baselines, it enables teams to detect deviations and
trends that might indicate emerging problems. This early warning system is
particularly valuable for e-commerce platforms, financial services, and other
sectors where downtime directly translates to lost revenue or reputation damage.

Another significant benefit is the ability to test from multiple geographic
locations, revealing regional performance variations that might affect user
experience. Synthetic monitoring also facilitates more accurate capacity
planning by providing consistent performance metrics under controlled conditions.
For DevOps teams, it serves as an objective measure of deployment success,
helping to validate that new releases meet performance expectations before
reaching production users. Furthermore, the historical data collected supports
root cause analysis and helps demonstrate compliance with service level
agreements.

## Implementation Best Practices

- **Focus on critical user journeys** - Prioritize monitoring for the most important business processes and high-traffic areas.

- **Establish performance baselines** - Document normal performance metrics to make anomalies easier to identify.

- **Distribute test locations strategically** - Place monitoring agents in regions that match your user base distribution.

- **Set meaningful alert thresholds** - Configure alerts based on business impact rather than arbitrary performance numbers.

- **Regularly review and update tests** - Adapt monitoring scripts as applications evolve to maintain relevance.

- **Combine with other monitoring types** - Use synthetic monitoring alongside RUM and infrastructure monitoring for complete visibility.

- **Test under various network conditions** - Simulate different connection speeds to understand performance across user environments.
