the Java programming language. The e-book is written in plain English.

The code examples were tested on Linux and Windows. They were built with Java
11. After purchasing the e-book, you will obtain a ZIP file. In the ZIP file,
you will find a PDF file and all code examples. The code examples are in the
form of IntelliJ IDEA projects.

## About this e-book

In the Java 2D games programming e-book, we show how to create six simple
2D games in Java and Swing.

The following is covered:

  - Foundations

  - Snake

  - Tetris

  - Minesweeper

  - Balloons

  - Flappy bird

  - Cannon

In the *Foundations* chapter, we quickly mention some fundamental
aspects of game programming in Java Swing, including the paint mechanism,
graphics object, and frame rate. The *Snake game* shows how to implement
the Snake game. It is a more complex version of the game than you find
on the ZetCode's tutorial. In the *Tetris* chapter we implement
the falling block puzzle game. In the *Minesweeper* chapter we show
how to create a simple Minesweeper clone, in which the player's goal is to
swipe all mines from the minefield.

The *Balloons* game is one of the best introductory games for learning
about 2D games programming. It is simple, clear and teaches a lot about game
programming. In the game we shoot balloons with an aiming target. In Flappy
bird
the player controls a bird which has to avoid pipes. In the *Cannon*
game, we shoot planes with a cannon. The game is a classic example of a shooting
projectile game. The game has an indicator of the power of the shot.
