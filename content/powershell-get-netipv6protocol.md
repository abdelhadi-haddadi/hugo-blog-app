# PowerShell Get-NetIPv6Protocol

last modified February 15, 2025

In this article, we will cover the Get-NetIPv6Protocol cmdlet in
PowerShell. This cmdlet retrieves IPv6 protocol configuration settings.

## IPv6 Protocol basics

IPv6 is the latest version of the Internet Protocol. It provides a larger
address space than IPv4 and improved routing efficiency. The protocol includes
features like stateless address autoconfiguration. PowerShell provides cmdlets
to manage IPv6 protocol settings. Get-NetIPv6Protocol shows current
configuration values.

## Basic Get-NetIPv6Protocol usage

The simplest way to use Get-NetIPv6Protocol is without parameters.
This displays all IPv6 protocol configuration settings. The output includes
properties like NeighborCacheLimit and RouterDiscovery. Each setting controls
specific IPv6 protocol behavior.

ipv6basic.ps1
  

Get-NetIPv6Protocol

This command retrieves all IPv6 protocol settings. The output shows current
values for various IPv6 configuration parameters. Settings are displayed in
a table format by default.

## Get specific IPv6 protocol setting

You can retrieve specific IPv6 protocol settings using property selection.
Pipe the output to Select-Object with desired property names. This is useful
when you only need certain configuration values. Multiple properties can be
selected at once.

ipv6specific.ps1
  

Get-NetIPv6Protocol | Select-Object NeighborCacheLimit, RouterDiscovery

This command shows only the NeighborCacheLimit and RouterDiscovery settings.
The output is simplified to just these two properties. This helps focus on
specific configuration values.

PS C:\&gt; .\ipv6specific.ps1

NeighborCacheLimit RouterDiscovery
------------------ --------------
               1024           True

## Format IPv6 protocol output as list

For detailed viewing, format the output as a list using Format-List. This
shows each property on a separate line with its value. All available properties
are displayed in this format. It's useful for comprehensive configuration review.

ipv6list.ps1
  

Get-NetIPv6Protocol | Format-List *

This command displays all IPv6 protocol settings in list format. Each property
is shown with its current configuration value. The output includes detailed
information about each setting.

## Check IPv6 router discovery status

Router discovery is an important IPv6 feature for network configuration. This
example checks if router discovery is enabled. The setting controls whether
the system discovers routers automatically. It's enabled by default in most
configurations.

ipv6router.ps1
  

Get-NetIPv6Protocol | Select-Object RouterDiscovery

This command retrieves only the RouterDiscovery setting status. The output
shows whether router discovery is enabled (True) or disabled (False). This
helps verify automatic router configuration.

## Compare IPv6 and IPv4 protocol settings

You can compare IPv6 and IPv4 protocol settings side by side. This example
shows both protocol configurations together. The comparison helps understand
differences between protocol versions. Use Get-NetIPv4Protocol for IPv4 data.

ipcompare.ps1
  

Get-NetIPv6Protocol | Select-Object NeighborCacheLimit, RouterDiscovery
Get-NetIPv4Protocol | Select-Object NeighborCacheLimit, RouterDiscovery

This command displays comparable settings from both IPv6 and IPv4 protocols.
The output shows how similar settings are configured differently. This helps
understand protocol-specific configurations.
