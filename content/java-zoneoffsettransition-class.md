# Java ZoneOffsetTransition Class

Last modified: April 16, 2025

 

The java.time.zone.ZoneOffsetTransition class represents a transition
between two offsets in a timezone. It models the moment when a timezone changes
its standard offset or daylight saving rules.

ZoneOffsetTransition is immutable and thread-safe. It is used
internally by the Java time API to handle timezone transitions. The class
provides information about the transition instant and offset changes.

## ZoneOffsetTransition Class Overview

ZoneOffsetTransition provides methods to examine timezone transitions.
Key operations include getting transition instant, offsets, and duration.
The class helps handle daylight saving time changes and other offset adjustments.

public final class ZoneOffsetTransition implements Comparable&lt;ZoneOffsetTransition&gt;, Serializable {
    public static ZoneOffsetTransition of(LocalDateTime transition, ZoneOffset before, ZoneOffset after);
    public Instant getInstant();
    public LocalDateTime getDateTimeBefore();
    public LocalDateTime getDateTimeAfter();
    public ZoneOffset getOffsetBefore();
    public ZoneOffset getOffsetAfter();
    public Duration getDuration();
    public boolean isGap();
    public boolean isOverlap();
    public boolean isValidOffset(ZoneOffset offset);
    public int compareTo(ZoneOffsetTransition transition);
}

The code above shows key methods provided by ZoneOffsetTransition.
These methods allow examining timezone transitions in detail. The class helps
understand how offsets change at specific moments in time.

## Creating ZoneOffsetTransition Objects

ZoneOffsetTransition objects are typically obtained from ZoneRules. However,
they can also be created directly for specific transitions. This example shows
both approaches.

Main.java
  

package com.zetcode;

import java.time.*;
import java.time.zone.*;

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        
        // Create transition directly
        ZoneOffsetTransition transition1 = ZoneOffsetTransition.of(
            LocalDateTime.of(2025, 3, 9, 2, 0),
            ZoneOffset.ofHours(-5),
            ZoneOffset.ofHours(-4)
        );
        System.out.println("Created transition: " + transition1);
        
        // Get transitions from ZoneRules
        ZoneRules rules = ZoneId.of("America/New_York").getRules();
        ZoneOffsetTransition transition2 = rules.getTransition(
            LocalDateTime.of(2025, 3, 9, 2, 0)
        );
        System.out.println("From ZoneRules: " + transition2);
    }
}

This example demonstrates two ways to create ZoneOffsetTransition objects.
The first creates a transition manually, while the second retrieves one from
timezone rules. Both represent the same daylight saving time transition.

## Examining Transition Properties

ZoneOffsetTransition provides methods to examine transition details. These
include the instant of transition, offsets before and after, and transition type.

Main.java
  

package com.zetcode;

import java.time.*;
import java.time.zone.*;

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        
        ZoneRules rules = ZoneId.of("America/New_York").getRules();
        ZoneOffsetTransition transition = rules.getTransition(
            LocalDateTime.of(2025, 11, 2, 2, 0)
        );
        
        System.out.println("Transition instant: " + transition.getInstant());
        System.out.println("Offset before: " + transition.getOffsetBefore());
        System.out.println("Offset after: " + transition.getOffsetAfter());
        System.out.println("Duration: " + transition.getDuration());
        System.out.println("Is gap: " + transition.isGap());
        System.out.println("Is overlap: " + transition.isOverlap());
    }
}

This example shows how to examine properties of a timezone transition. The
output reveals details about the fall daylight saving time change in New York.
The duration shows the 1-hour difference between offsets.

## Checking Valid Offsets

The isValidOffset method checks if a specific offset was valid
at the transition point. This helps determine which local times were valid
during transitions.

Main.java
  

package com.zetcode;

import java.time.*;
import java.time.zone.*;

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        
        ZoneRules rules = ZoneId.of("America/New_York").getRules();
        ZoneOffsetTransition transition = rules.getTransition(
            LocalDateTime.of(2025, 3, 8, 2, 0)
        );
        
        ZoneOffset before = transition.getOffsetBefore();
        ZoneOffset after = transition.getOffsetAfter();
        
        System.out.println("Is before offset valid? " + 
            transition.isValidOffset(before));
        System.out.println("Is after offset valid? " + 
            transition.isValidOffset(after));
        System.out.println("Is UTC offset valid? " + 
            transition.isValidOffset(ZoneOffset.UTC));
    }
}

This example checks which offsets were valid during a daylight saving time
transition. The method returns true only for offsets that were valid at the
exact transition moment. This helps handle ambiguous times during transitions.

## Handling Gap Transitions

Gap transitions occur when clocks move forward, creating a period of local time
that doesn't exist. The isGap method identifies these transitions.

Main.java
  

package com.zetcode;

import java.time.*;
import java.time.zone.*;

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        
        ZoneRules rules = ZoneId.of("America/New_York").getRules();
        ZoneOffsetTransition transition = rules.getTransition(
            LocalDateTime.of(2025, 3, 9, 2, 0)
        );
        
        if (transition.isGap()) {
            System.out.println("This is a gap transition");
            System.out.println("Local time jumps from " + 
                transition.getDateTimeBefore() + " to " +
                transition.getDateTimeAfter());
        } else {
            System.out.println("This is not a gap transition");
        }
    }
}

This example demonstrates how to detect and handle gap transitions. During
daylight saving time start, local time jumps forward, creating a gap. The
example shows the exact moment when this occurs in New York timezone.

## Handling Overlap Transitions

Overlap transitions occur when clocks move backward, creating a period of local
time that occurs twice. The isOverlap method identifies these.

Main.java
  

package com.zetcode;

import java.time.*;
import java.time.zone.*;

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        
        ZoneRules rules = ZoneId.of("America/New_York").getRules();
        ZoneOffsetTransition transition = rules.getTransition(
            LocalDateTime.of(2025, 11, 2, 2, 0)
        );
        
        if (transition.isOverlap()) {
            System.out.println("This is an overlap transition");
            System.out.println("Local time repeats from " + 
                transition.getDateTimeBefore() + " to " +
                transition.getDateTimeAfter());
        } else {
            System.out.println("This is not an overlap transition");
        }
    }
}

This example shows how to detect and handle overlap transitions. During daylight
saving time end, local time moves back, creating an overlap. The example shows
this transition in New York timezone.

## Comparing Transitions

ZoneOffsetTransition implements Comparable, allowing transitions to be sorted
chronologically. The comparison is based on the transition instant.

Main.java
  

package com.zetcode;

import java.time.*;
import java.time.zone.*;
import java.util.*;

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        
        ZoneRules rules = ZoneId.of("America/New_York").getRules();
        List&lt;ZoneOffsetTransition&gt; transitions = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;(
            rules.getTransitions().subList(0, 5)
        );
        
        System.out.println("Original order:");
        transitions.forEach(System.out::println);
        
        Collections.shuffle(transitions);
        System.out.println("\nShuffled order:");
        transitions.forEach(System.out::println);
        
        Collections.sort(transitions);
        System.out.println("\nSorted order:");
        transitions.forEach(System.out::println);
    }
}

This example demonstrates comparing and sorting ZoneOffsetTransition objects.
The transitions are first displayed in original order, then shuffled, and
finally sorted chronologically. The comparison uses the transition instant.
