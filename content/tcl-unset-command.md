# Tcl unset Command

last modified April 3, 2025

The Tcl unset command is used to remove variables or array elements.
It helps manage memory by cleaning up unused variables. The command can remove
single variables or multiple variables at once.

## Basic Definition

The unset command destroys one or more variables. Once unset, the
variable no longer exists in the current scope. Attempting to access it will
raise an error.

Syntax: unset ?-nocomplain? ?--? ?name name ...?. The optional
-nocomplain suppresses errors for non-existent variables.

## Basic Variable Removal

This shows the simplest usage of unset to remove a single variable.

basic_unset.tcl
  

set name "John Doe"
puts "Before unset: $name"
unset name
puts "After unset: [info exists name]"

This creates a variable name, prints it, then removes it with
unset. The info exists command checks if the variable
still exists.

## Removing Multiple Variables

The unset command can remove several variables in one operation.

unset_multiple.tcl
  

set x 10
set y 20
set z 30
puts "Before: x=$x, y=$y, z=$z"
unset x y z
puts "After: x exists? [info exists x]"

This creates three variables, then removes them all with one unset
command. The example verifies removal by checking variable existence.

## Unsetting Array Elements

unset can remove individual elements from an array while keeping
the array intact.

unset_array.tcl
  

array set colors {
    red   #ff0000
    green #00ff00
    blue  #0000ff
}
puts "Before: [array get colors]"
unset colors(green)
puts "After: [array get colors]"

This creates an array of colors, then removes the green element. The remaining
array elements are still accessible after the operation.

## Using -nocomplain Option

The -nocomplain option prevents errors when unsetting non-existent
variables.

unset_nocomplain.tcl
  

# This would normally cause an error
unset -nocomplain non_existent_var
puts "Command completed without error"

set temp_var "temporary"
unset -nocomplain temp_var non_existent_var
puts "Mixed unset completed"

This shows how -nocomplain allows the script to continue even when
some variables don't exist. Useful for cleanup scripts.

## Unsetting Variables in Procedures

Variables in procedures can be unset to free memory before procedure completion.

unset_proc.tcl
  

proc calculate {} {
    set a 5
    set b 10
    set result [expr {$a * $b}]
    unset a b
    return $result
}
puts "Result: [calculate]"

This procedure calculates a result, then unsets its temporary variables before
returning. This is good practice for memory management in larger scripts.

## Unsetting Entire Arrays

The unset command can remove entire arrays with a single operation.

unset_whole_array.tcl
  

array set user {
    name John
    age 30
    city New York
}
puts "Before: [array exists user]"
unset user
puts "After: [array exists user]"

This creates an array, then removes it completely. The array exists
command verifies the array's existence before and after unset.

## Best Practices

- **Cleanup:** Unset large variables when no longer needed.

- **Scope:** Be mindful of variable scope when unsetting.

- **Arrays:** Unset entire arrays to free all elements.

- **Safety:** Use -nocomplain for optional cleanup.

- **Testing:** Check with info exists before accessing.
