# Angular - Overview

URL: https://www.tutorialspoint.com/angular/angular-overview.htm

Angular is aTypeScriptbased full-stack web framework for building web and mobile applications. One of the major advantages is that Angular support for web applications that can fit in any screen resolution. Angular application is fully compatible with mobiles, tablets, laptops or desktops. Angular has an excellent user interface library for web developers which contains reusable UI components.

This functionality helps us to create Single Page Applications (SPA). SPA is a reactive and fast application. For example, if you have a button in single page and click on the button then the action performs dynamically in the current page without loading the new page from the server. Angular is a TypeScript-based framework that supports object-oriented programming and includes features for server-side rendering as well.

As we know already, Google releases the version ofAngularfor the improvement of mobile and web development capabilities. All the released versions are backwards compatible and can be updated easily to the newer version. Lets go through the comparison of released versions.

AngularJS (October 2010)

AngularJS is based on Model View Controller (MVC) architecture and automatically handles JavaScript code suitable for each browser.

It is a re-engineered and rewritten version of AngularJS. AngularJs had a focus on controllers but, version 2 has changed the focus on components. Components are the main building block of application. It supports features for speed in rendering, updating pages and building cross-platform native mobile apps for Google Android and iOS.
