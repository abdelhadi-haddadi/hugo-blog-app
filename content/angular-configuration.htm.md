# Angular - Configuration

URL: https://www.tutorialspoint.com/angular/angular-configuration.htm

This chapter will discuss theconfigurationof an Angular application, including important files, their specific role and usage in the Angular project, advantages, etc.

The Angular configuration is a set of instructions that defines how the Angular application is built and developed. It includes various information about the Angular application such asÂproject files,Âtools,environments, and some other dependencies.



Here is a list of importantconfiguration filesthat are automatically created when an Angular application is built using theAngular CLI. These files are important for running, deploying, and testing the application.

In an Angular application, theangular.jsonfile is a key configuration file that defines and manages all the settings for the Angular CLI (Command Line Interface). This file is necessary for customizing various aspects of your Angular project.

Theangular.jsonfile will look like:

This file contains key aspects of your Angular project, such as the "application name", "index.html", "main.ts", "assets", "styles", "scripts", "environment configurations", "build" and "test" options, and other settings important for your Angular applicationâs build and deployment process.

Here are a few important aspects of the angular.json file that you should know:

In an Angular application, thepackage.jsonfile serves as a fundamental part of managing the project'sdependenciesandscripts. It contains "metadata" about the project, including the project "name", "version", "scripts for starting', "building", "serving", and "watching the application", as well as the "dependencies" and "devDependencies".

Thepackage.jsonfile data will look like this:

Here are a few important aspects of the package.json file that you should know:

In an Angular application, themain.tsfile serves as theentry point. It is responsible for "bootstrapping" the root module or component. When you run theng servecommand, it compiles the application and looks for the "main.ts" file first to initiate the "bootstrapping process".

If themain.tsfile is missing or has issues, your application will fail to start, and you will face errors.

Themain.tsfile data will look like this:

Here,

A given Angular workspace contains severalTypeScriptconfiguration files. At the roottsconfig.jsonfile specifies the base TypeScript and Angular compiler options that all projects in the workspace inherit.

Initially, thetsconfig.jsonfile data will look like this:

In conclusion, Angular configuration plays an important role in ensuring that your Angular application runs smoothly without any lag or errors. It involves setting up various aspects of the application, such as "environment settings", "build configurations", "module imports", etc.
