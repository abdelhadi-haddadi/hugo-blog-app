# 5G - Expansion

URL: https://www.tutorialspoint.com/5g/5g_expansion.htm

5G networks are quickly growing in many parts of the world. They are changing how we communicate, get information, and use technology. These expanding 5G networks are helping industries to improve and boosting economic growth. In this section, we will explore the growth of 5G users and its impact on the global economy.

The number of 5G users has been increasing exponentially since its introduction in 2020. Currently, over 30% of the total world population has access to the 5G network. As infrastructure continues to expand, the reach of 5G is expected to grow from urban areas to rural areas.

The graph above shows how the number of 5G users has grown from 2020 to 2024. It shows a constant increase in number of users. Currently, in 2024 about 2 billon peoples have access to 5g network across world.

5G coverage is expanding rapidly across major regions around the world. Countries like the USA, India, and Canada have extensive 5G coverage, reaching both urban and some rural areas. The deployment of 5G is significantly enhancing connectivity and enabling new technological advancements.

The image above illustrates the global coverage areas of 5G networks. The purple-colored regions represent areas with strong 5G coverage. Some regions have widespread adoption, others are still in the early stages of developing their networks. North America, parts of Europe, China, India, and Australia are leading in 5G availability, while other regions, particularly in Africa and parts of Asia, have less coverage.

The 5G network is expected to boost global economy in many ways. Here are some of the key economic effects of 5G:

Further, it is expected that Industries like automotive, healthcare, and entertainment will see major benefits from 5G networks. This will also play a critical role in the development of smart cities, autonomous vehicles, and advanced AI applications. The full impact of 5G will continue to evolve over the coming years, but its potential to transform the global economy is already clear.
