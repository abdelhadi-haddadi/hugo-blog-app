# Java CharArrayWriter Class

Last modified: April 16, 2025

 

The java.io.CharArrayWriter class implements a character buffer that
can be used as a Writer. The buffer grows automatically as data is written to it.
Data can be retrieved using toCharArray() and toString() methods.

CharArrayWriter is useful when you need to write characters to memory
rather than a file or network. It provides methods to access the written data as
a character array or string. The class handles all character encoding internally.

## CharArrayWriter Class Overview

CharArrayWriter extends Writer and provides in-memory
character buffer operations. Key methods include write operations, buffer size
management, and data retrieval. The buffer automatically expands as needed.

public class CharArrayWriter extends Writer {
    public CharArrayWriter();
    public CharArrayWriter(int initialSize);
    public void write(int c);
    public void write(char[] c, int off, int len);
    public void write(String str, int off, int len);
    public void writeTo(Writer out);
    public void append(CharSequence csq);
    public void append(CharSequence csq, int start, int end);
    public void append(char c);
    public void reset();
    public char[] toCharArray();
    public int size();
    public String toString();
    public void flush();
    public void close();
}

The code above shows key methods provided by CharArrayWriter. These
methods allow writing characters to an in-memory buffer and retrieving them. The
class is particularly useful for testing or when you need to capture output.

## Creating a CharArrayWriter

CharArrayWriter can be created with a default initial size or a custom size. The
buffer grows automatically when needed. The default constructor creates a buffer
with 32 characters initial capacity.

Main.java
  

import java.io.CharArrayWriter;

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create with default size
        CharArrayWriter writer1 = new CharArrayWriter();
        
        // Create with custom initial size
        CharArrayWriter writer2 = new CharArrayWriter(1024);
        
        System.out.println("Default size writer created");
        System.out.println("Custom size (1024) writer created");
        
        // Write some data
        writer1.write("Hello");
        writer2.write("World");
        
        System.out.println("Writer1 content: " + writer1.toString());
        System.out.println("Writer2 content: " + writer2.toString());
        
        writer1.close();
        writer2.close();
    }
}

This example demonstrates different ways to create CharArrayWriter. The first uses
default size while the second specifies 1024 characters. Data is written to both
writers and then retrieved as strings. Always close writers when done.

## Writing Data to CharArrayWriter

CharArrayWriter provides multiple write methods for different data types. You can
write single characters, character arrays, strings, or portions of them. All data
is appended to the internal buffer.

Main.java
  

import java.io.CharArrayWriter;

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try (CharArrayWriter writer = new CharArrayWriter()) {
            
            // Write single character
            writer.write('A');
            
            // Write character array
            char[] chars = {'B', 'C', 'D'};
            writer.write(chars);
            
            // Write portion of character array
            writer.write(chars, 1, 2);
            
            // Write string
            writer.write("EFG");
            
            // Write portion of string
            writer.write("HIJKLM", 2, 3);
            
            System.out.println("Writer content: " + writer.toString());
        }
    }
}

This example shows various write operations supported by CharArrayWriter. The
output combines all written data: 'A' + "BCD" + "CD" + "EFG" + "JKL". The
try-with-resources ensures proper cleanup. The buffer automatically grows as
needed.

## Retrieving Data from CharArrayWriter

Data can be retrieved from CharArrayWriter as a character array or string. The
toCharArray() method returns a copy of the buffer contents. The toString()
method converts the buffer to a string.

Main.java
  

import java.io.CharArrayWriter;

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        CharArrayWriter writer = new CharArrayWriter();
        
        writer.write("Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet");
        
        // Get as character array
        char[] charArray = writer.toCharArray();
        System.out.println("Character array length: " + charArray.length);
        System.out.println("First character: " + charArray[0]);
        
        // Get as string
        String content = writer.toString();
        System.out.println("String content: " + content);
        
        // Get size
        System.out.println("Buffer size: " + writer.size());
        
        writer.close();
    }
}

This example demonstrates retrieving data from CharArrayWriter. The toCharArray()
method returns a new character array copy. The toString() method creates a string
from the buffer. The size() method returns the current number of characters in
the buffer.

## Writing to Another Writer

The writeTo() method writes the buffer contents to another Writer. This is useful
for transferring collected data to another output destination. The method writes
the entire buffer contents.

Main.java
  

import java.io.CharArrayWriter;
import java.io.FileWriter;
import java.io.IOException;

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        CharArrayWriter writer = new CharArrayWriter();
        writer.write("This text will be written to a file");
        
        try (FileWriter fileWriter = new FileWriter("output.txt")) {
            // Write buffer contents to file
            writer.writeTo(fileWriter);
            System.out.println("Data written to file successfully");
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
        
        writer.close();
    }
}

This example shows how to transfer data from CharArrayWriter to a FileWriter. The
writeTo() method writes all collected characters to the specified Writer. This
pattern is useful when you need to buffer output before writing it to its final
destination.

## Resetting the Buffer

The reset() method clears the buffer contents while keeping the underlying buffer
allocated. This is more efficient than creating a new CharArrayWriter when you
need to reuse the buffer. The buffer capacity remains unchanged.

Main.java
  

import java.io.CharArrayWriter;

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        CharArrayWriter writer = new CharArrayWriter();
        
        // First usage
        writer.write("First content");
        System.out.println("First content: " + writer.toString());
        System.out.println("Size after first write: " + writer.size());
        
        // Reset buffer
        writer.reset();
        System.out.println("Size after reset: " + writer.size());
        
        // Second usage
        writer.write("New content");
        System.out.println("Second content: " + writer.toString());
        System.out.println("Size after second write: " + writer.size());
        
        writer.close();
    }
}

This example demonstrates using reset() to reuse a CharArrayWriter. After writing
data and calling reset(), the buffer is empty but maintains its capacity. This is
more efficient than creating new instances when processing multiple items.

## Appending Data

CharArrayWriter implements Appendable, allowing data to be appended using the
append() methods. These methods work similarly to write() but return the
CharArrayWriter for method chaining. They accept characters, CharSequences, or
portions of CharSequences.

Main.java
  

import java.io.CharArrayWriter;

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        CharArrayWriter writer = new CharArrayWriter();
        
        // Append various data types
        writer.append('A')
              .append("BC")
              .append("DEF", 1, 3)
              .append('G');
        
        System.out.println("Appended content: " + writer.toString());
        
        // Append with StringBuilder
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder("HIJ");
        writer.append(sb);
        
        System.out.println("After StringBuilder append: " + writer.toString());
        
        writer.close();
    }
}

This example shows how to use append() methods for fluent writing. The methods
return the CharArrayWriter instance, allowing method chaining. The output is
"ABCDEFGHIJ". Append operations are convenient for building complex output
through chained calls.
