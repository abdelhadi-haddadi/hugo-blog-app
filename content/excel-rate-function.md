# Excel RATE Function

last modified April 4, 2025

The RATE function calculates the interest rate per period of an 
annuity. It's essential for financial analysis, loan calculations, and 
investment planning. This tutorial provides a comprehensive guide to using 
the RATE function with detailed examples. You'll learn the syntax, 
practical applications, and advanced techniques.

## RATE Function Basics

The RATE function returns the interest rate per period for a loan 
or investment. It uses iterative calculation to find the rate. The function is 
commonly used in financial analysis.

  
    Component
    Description
  
  
    Function Name
    RATE
  
  
    Syntax
    =RATE(nper, pmt, pv, [fv], [type], [guess])
  
  
    Required Arguments
    nper, pmt, pv
  
  
    Optional Arguments
    fv, type, guess
  
  
    Return Value
    Interest rate per period
  

This table breaks down the essential components of the RATE
function. It shows the function name, syntax format, required and optional 
arguments, and return value characteristics.

## Basic Loan Interest Rate Calculation

This example calculates the monthly interest rate for a loan with fixed 
payments. We'll determine the rate for a $10,000 loan paid over 5 years.

  
    Parameter
    Value
  
  
    Loan Amount (pv)
    $10,000
  
  
    Term (nper)
    60 months
  
  
    Monthly Payment (pmt)
    -$200
  
  
    Future Value (fv)
    0
  
  
    Type
    0 (payments at end)
  

The table shows loan parameters for calculating the monthly interest rate. 
Negative payment indicates cash outflow. Future value is zero as loan will be 
fully paid.

Basic RATE formula
  

=RATE(60, -200, 10000)

This formula calculates the monthly interest rate for a $10,000 loan with 60 
monthly payments of $200. The result is approximately 0.77% per month. To get 
annual rate, multiply by 12 (9.24%).

## Investment Growth Rate Calculation

This example calculates the required annual return rate for an investment to 
reach a target value. We'll find the rate needed to grow $5,000 to $10,000.

  
    Parameter
    Value
  
  
    Present Value (pv)
    -$5,000
  
  
    Future Value (fv)
    $10,000
  
  
    Term (nper)
    10 years
  
  
    Payment (pmt)
    0
  

The table shows investment parameters. Negative present value indicates initial 
cash outflow. No periodic payments are made in this lump-sum investment.

Investment growth rate
  

=RATE(10, 0, -5000, 10000)

This formula calculates the annual growth rate needed to turn $5,000 into 
$10,000 in 10 years. The result is approximately 7.18% per year. This shows 
how RATE can determine required investment returns.

## Annuity Interest Rate with Payments at Beginning

This example calculates the interest rate for an annuity with payments at the 
beginning of each period. We'll find the rate for a $100,000 investment.

  
    Parameter
    Value
  
  
    Present Value (pv)
    $100,000
  
  
    Annual Payment (pmt)
    -$12,000
  
  
    Term (nper)
    15 years
  
  
    Type
    1 (beginning)
  

The table shows annuity parameters. Payment is negative as cash outflow. Type 1 
indicates payments at period start. Future value defaults to zero.

Annuity with beginning payments
  

=RATE(15, -12000, 100000, 0, 1)

This formula calculates the annual interest rate for a $100,000 annuity paying 
$12,000 at the start of each year for 15 years. The result is approximately 
8.45%. The type parameter affects the calculation.

## Loan with Balloon Payment

This example calculates the interest rate for a loan with a balloon payment. 
We'll find the rate for a $50,000 loan with $400 monthly payments and $10,000 
balloon.

  
    Parameter
    Value
  
  
    Loan Amount (pv)
    $50,000
  
  
    Monthly Payment (pmt)
    -$400
  
  
    Term (nper)
    60 months
  
  
    Balloon Payment (fv)
    -$10,000
  

The table shows loan parameters with balloon payment. Both payment and future 
value are negative as cash outflows. Term is 5 years (60 months).

Loan with balloon payment
  

=RATE(60, -400, 50000, -10000)

This formula calculates the monthly interest rate for a $50,000 loan with $400 
monthly payments and $10,000 balloon after 5 years. The result is approximately 
0.58% monthly (6.96% annual). Balloon payments affect the rate calculation.

## Using Guess Parameter for Convergence

This example demonstrates using the guess parameter when RATE fails to 
converge. We'll calculate rate for an unusual cash flow pattern.

  
    Parameter
    Value
  
  
    Present Value (pv)
    $1,000
  
  
    Payment (pmt)
    -$300
  
  
    Term (nper)
    5 periods
  
  
    Guess
    0.1 (10%)
  

The table shows parameters for a scenario where RATE might not converge without 
a guess. The payment is large relative to present value, which can cause issues.

RATE with guess parameter
  

=RATE(5, -300, 1000, 0, 0, 0.1)

This formula calculates the periodic rate for $1,000 investment returning $300 
per period for 5 periods. With guess of 10%, it returns approximately 15.24%. 
Without guess, it might return error.

## Comparing Loan Options

This example compares two loan options by calculating their effective rates. 
We'll determine which option has better terms.

  
    Parameter
    Option 1
    Option 2
  
  
    Loan Amount
    $25,000
    $25,000
  
  
    Term
    36 months
    48 months
  
  
    Payment
    -$800
    -$650
  

The table compares two loan options with different terms and payments. We'll 
calculate monthly rates for both to determine which is more favorable.

Comparing loan rates
  

=RATE(36, -800, 25000)  // Option 1: ~1.15% monthly
=RATE(48, -650, 25000)  // Option 2: ~0.92% monthly

These formulas calculate monthly rates for both options. Option 1 has 1.15% 
monthly (13.8% annual), Option 2 has 0.92% monthly (11.04% annual). Option 2 
has better rate despite longer term.

The RATE function is powerful for financial analysis. It helps 
compare loans, evaluate investments, and plan finances. Remember cash flow 
signs (negative for outflows) and use guess when needed. Annualize periodic 
rates by multiplying by periods per year.
