## About this tutorial

This is SQLite Python e-book. This e-book is a tutorial,
which teaches database programming with SQLite database and
Python language. It is an in-depth e-book, which covers many
areas in great detail.

This e-book covers the following:

  - Terms and concepts

  - Execution of SQL statements

  - Data types

  - Reading data

  - Foreign keys

  - Date &amp; time

  - Custom functions

  - Collation

  - Binary data

  - Metadata

  - Authorization

  - Transactions

  - SQLAlchemy

  - PyQt5 QtSql module

The first chapter presents a quick overview of important terms and
concepts related to our field. 
In the second chapter, we cover all the methods used for executing SQL
statements. We show how to properly execute SQL statements to avoid
SQL injections.  

The Data types chapter examines the dynamic type system of the SQLite database.
We describe the data types of the SQLite database and the conversion between 
them and the types of the Python language. The next chapter shows various ways
of reading data from the database.

The fifth chapter covers foreign keys in the SQLite database.  We cover
the ISO-8601 format, Unix time, UTC time, conversions or Julian date among others. 

In the Custom functions chapter, we have examples for normal and aggregate custom
functions. The Collation chapter deals with ordering and sorting of characters.
We mention the SQLite's limitations in this area and show how to create our
custom collations. 

In the Binary data chapter, we work with images. We show how to insert and
read an image. The Metadata chapter has multiple examples for dealing with
metadata in SQLite. 

The Authorization chapter focuses on the authorization process available in SQLite.
The Transactions chapter provides several code examples with transaction support. 

The SQLAlchemy chapter gives a brief but sufficient introduction to the
SQLAlchemy Object-relational mapper. The last chapter is dedicated to QtSql module 
of the PyQt5 toolkit.
