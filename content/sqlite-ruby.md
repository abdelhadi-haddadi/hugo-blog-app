## SQLite &amp; Ruby

*SQLite* is an embedded relational database engine. 
It is a self-contained, serverless, zero-configuration and transactional SQL 
database engine. SQLite implements most of the SQL-92 standard for SQL. The SQLite 
engine is not a standalone process. Instead, it is statically or dynamically linked 
into the application. An SQLite database is a single ordinary disk file that can be 
located anywhere in the directory hierarchy.

*Ruby* is a dynamic, reflective, general-purpose object-oriented programming language.
Recently it became very popular in web programming, mainly due to the successful
Ruby on Rails framework.
