# PowerShell Debug-Process

last modified February 15, 2025

In this article, we will cover the Debug-Process cmdlet in
PowerShell. This cmdlet attaches a debugger to running processes for
troubleshooting and analysis.

## Debugging basics

Debugging is the process of identifying and resolving issues in software.
The Debug-Process cmdlet attaches a debugger to running processes.
This allows inspection of process state, variables, and execution flow.
Debugging requires appropriate permissions on the target process.

## Basic Debug-Process usage

The simplest way to use Debug-Process is with a process ID.
This attaches the default debugger to the specified process. The debugger
must be installed and configured on the system. This is useful for analyzing
hanging or misbehaving applications.

debug1.ps1
  

Debug-Process -Id 1234

This command attaches a debugger to the process with ID 1234. No output is
returned unless there's an error. The debugger interface will appear if
configured properly.

## Debug process by name

You can debug processes by name using the -Name parameter. This attaches
the debugger to all processes matching the specified name. Wildcards are
supported for partial matching. Be cautious as this affects all matching
processes.

debug2.ps1
  

Debug-Process -Name "notepad"

This command attaches a debugger to all running Notepad processes. Multiple
debugger instances may launch if several Notepad windows are open.

## Debug multiple processes

You can debug multiple processes by passing multiple IDs or names. This
is useful when debugging related processes. Separate the values with commas.
Each specified process will have a debugger attached.

debug3.ps1
  

Debug-Process -Id 1234, 5678, 9012

This command attaches debuggers to three different processes. Each process
must be accessible and debuggable. The command fails if any process cannot
be debugged.

## Debug with specific debugger

You can specify which debugger to use with the -Debugger parameter. This
is useful when multiple debuggers are installed. The debugger must be
registered and available on the system. Common options include VSJitDebugger.

debug4.ps1
  

Debug-Process -Name "calc" -Debugger "VSJitDebugger"

This command attaches the Visual Studio Just-In-Time debugger to Calculator.
The specified debugger must be properly installed and configured.

## Debug with confirmation prompt

For safety, you can add a confirmation prompt before debugging. Use the
-Confirm parameter to enable this. This prevents accidental debugging of
critical processes. The user must confirm before proceeding.

debug5.ps1
  

Debug-Process -Name "explorer" -Confirm

This command prompts for confirmation before attaching to Explorer. This
is important as debugging system processes can affect stability.

## Debug with WhatIf simulation

The -WhatIf parameter shows what would happen without actually debugging.
This is useful for testing commands safely. It displays which processes
would be affected. No actual debugging occurs with this parameter.

debug6.ps1
  

Debug-Process -Name "chrome" -WhatIf

This command simulates debugging Chrome processes. It shows which processes
would be debugged without actually attaching any debuggers.

## Debug processes from pipeline

You can pipe process objects directly to Debug-Process. This allows filtering
and selection before debugging. Combine with Get-Process for powerful debugging
workflows. Only processes with sufficient permissions can be debugged.

debug7.ps1
  

Get-Process -Name "powershell" | Debug-Process

This command gets all PowerShell processes and attaches debuggers to them.
The pipeline passes the process objects directly to the debugging command.

## Debug with error handling

Add error handling to manage debugging failures gracefully. Use try/catch
blocks to capture and handle exceptions. This prevents script termination
when debugging fails. Common errors include permission issues.

debug8.ps1
  

try {
    Debug-Process -Id 9999 -ErrorAction Stop
}
catch {
    Write-Host "Debugging failed: $_"
}

This command attempts to debug process 9999 and catches any errors. The
error message is displayed if debugging fails. The -ErrorAction parameter
ensures exceptions are thrown.
