# Excel EDATE Function

last modified April 4, 2025

The EDATE function is a powerful date function in Excel that 
returns a date a specified number of months before or after a start date. 
This tutorial provides a comprehensive guide to using the EDATE 
function with detailed examples. You'll learn basic syntax, practical 
applications, and advanced techniques.

## EDATE Function Basics

The EDATE function calculates a date a specified number of months 
before or after a given start date. It's particularly useful for financial 
calculations, project planning, and any scenario requiring date manipulation.

  
    Component
    Description
  
  
    Function Name
    EDATE
  
  
    Syntax
    =EDATE(start_date, months)
  
  
    Arguments
    start_date (date), months (integer)
  
  
    Return Value
    Date as serial number (formatted as date)
  

This table breaks down the essential components of the EDATE
function. The start_date can be a date serial number, text date, or reference.
The months argument can be positive (future) or negative (past).

## Basic EDATE Example

This example demonstrates the simplest use of the EDATE function with a fixed 
date and month offset.

Basic EDATE formula
  

=EDATE("2023-01-15", 3)

This formula calculates the date 3 months after January 15, 2023. The result 
will be April 15, 2023. The date must be in a format Excel recognizes.

## EDATE with Cell References

A more practical use of EDATE involves referencing cells for both 
the start date and month offset. Here's an example with cell references.

  
    A
    B
    C
  
  
    Start Date
    Months
    Result
  
  
    2023-03-10
    6
    =EDATE(A2, B2)
  

The table shows a simple spreadsheet with a start date in A2 and months offset 
in B2. The EDATE formula in C2 calculates the resulting date.

EDATE with cell references
  

=EDATE(A2, B2)

This formula calculates the date 6 months after March 10, 2023. The result 
will be September 10, 2023. Using cell references makes the formula dynamic.

## EDATE with Negative Months

EDATE can calculate dates in the past by using negative numbers for the months 
argument. This example shows this functionality.

  
    A
    B
    C
  
  
    Start Date
    Months
    Result
  
  
    2023-05-20
    -4
    =EDATE(A2, B2)
  

This table demonstrates EDATE's ability to calculate past dates. The negative 
value in B2 (-4) tells EDATE to calculate 4 months before the start date.

EDATE with negative months
  

=EDATE(A2, B2)

This formula calculates the date 4 months before May 20, 2023. The result will 
be January 20, 2023. Negative values provide flexibility for date calculations.

## EDATE with End-of-Month Dates

EDATE handles end-of-month dates intelligently. If the start date is the last 
day of a month, EDATE returns the last day of the resulting month.

  
    A
    B
    C
  
  
    Start Date
    Months
    Result
  
  
    2023-01-31
    1
    =EDATE(A2, B2)
  

The table shows how EDATE handles January 31 when adding 1 month. Since 
February doesn't have 31 days, EDATE returns February 28 (or 29 in leap years).

EDATE with end-of-month date
  

=EDATE(A2, B2)

This formula calculates 1 month after January 31, 2023. The result will be 
February 28, 2023 (not March 3). This behavior is important for financial 
calculations involving month-ends.

## EDATE for Loan Payment Schedule

EDATE is commonly used to create payment schedules. This example shows how to 
generate a series of monthly payment dates.

  
    A
    B
  
  
    Start Date
    2023-06-15
  
  
    Payment 1
    =EDATE(B1, 1)
  
  
    Payment 2
    =EDATE(B2, 1)
  
  
    Payment 3
    =EDATE(B3, 1)
  

This table demonstrates creating a payment schedule where each payment date is 
exactly 1 month after the previous one. The formulas reference the cell above.

EDATE for payment schedule
  

=EDATE(B1, 1)  // First payment
=EDATE(B2, 1)  // Second payment
=EDATE(B3, 1)  // Third payment

These formulas create a sequence of monthly payment dates starting from June 15, 
2023. Each formula calculates 1 month after the previous date, maintaining the 
same day of month when possible.

## EDATE with DATE Function

EDATE can be combined with the DATE function for more flexible date creation. 
This example shows this powerful combination.

EDATE with DATE function
  

=EDATE(DATE(2023, 3, 1), 5)

This formula first creates March 1, 2023 using DATE, then adds 5 months. The 
result will be August 1, 2023. Combining these functions allows dynamic date 
creation and manipulation.

The EDATE function is essential for financial calculations, project 
planning, and any date manipulation in Excel. From simple month additions to 
complex schedules, EDATE handles it efficiently. Mastering EDATE will 
significantly improve your date-related calculations in spreadsheets.
