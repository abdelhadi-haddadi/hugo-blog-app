# Angular - Dynamic components

URL: https://www.tutorialspoint.com/angular/angular-dynamic-components.htm

Angular allows the component to be dynamically created and loaded at run time at a specific location in the host (another) component. Loading a component at run time opens a lot of opportunities to do advanced functionality. For example, a banner rotation component can accept heavily customized banner item instead of accepting banners confirming to a specific template, which is always pre-defined and static in nature.

Let us learn how to create an Angular component at run time and attach it to the host component in this chapter.

There are two ways to create dynamic components in Angular:

TheNgComponentOutletis a directive that helps in dynamic component creation. It instantiates a Component and embeds its view (host view) inside the current view. Please note it only accepts Components and to use it, you need to importCommonModule.

In this example, we see the practical implementation ofNgComponentOutletdirective. Here, we create an Angular application that will have two main child components and they will be associated with buttons namedAdminandUser. On clicking the Admin button,AdminBioComponentwill be displayed and when you click the User button,StandardBioComponentwill be displayed.

Step 1:CreateAdminBioComponentusing the given command −

Step 2:Create a second component,StandardBioComponentusing the command given below −

Step 3:We need another component that will contain the logic of dynamic component creation.

Step 4:Now, openadmin-bio.component.htmlfile and copy the below code −

Step 5:Then, openstandard-bio.component.htmlfile and copy the below code −

Step 6:Next, opencheck-bio.component.htmlfile and copy the below code −

Step 7:In thecheck-bio.component.tsfile, create a method namedgetBioComponent(). This method will check which button is clicked among the two and display the view accordingly. The complete code is given below −

Step 8:Next, openapp.component.htmlfile and copy the below code −

Here, the given buttons will trigger theadmin()anduserLog()methods. The*ngIfdirective conditionally includes the <div> element in the DOM if theisValidproperty is true. If it is false, the <div> and its contents are not rendered.

Step 10:Finally, inside theapp.component.tsfile, copy the below code −

The second way of creating and rendering components dynamically is by usingViewContainerRef. Other components or directives use it to get a reference to a view container corresponding to their location in the DOM. In this way, ViewContainerRef helps to dynamically create and insert components at that specific location.

Let us create a real time application to display a collection of employees in two different formats, table and gallery. We will create two components, one to show employees in the table and another in gallery format. Then we will create a host component, which will dynamically load either table based component or gallery based component.

Step 1:Create an interface to hold common data across multiple dynamic component

Step 2:Create a directive, DynSample. The purpose of the directive is to target and select the view container (where dynamic component will be placed) in the host component template.

Step 3:Create a dynamic component, DynList. The purpose of the component is to list the employee as gallery.

Step 4:Create a dynamic component, DynTable. The purpose of the component is to list the employees in tabular format.

Step 5:Create a host component, DynHost. The purpose of the component is to host any one of the component, DynList and DynTable based on configuration.

Step 6:Next, open DynSampleDirective and start updating the code. The code generated by angular CLI is as follows,

Here,

Attribute directive purpose is to target the element (ng-template) in the host components template where the dynamic component will be injected.

appDynSample is the selector to target and select the element (ng-template). The dynamic component will be created, initialized and injected into the appHello element (ng-template) later.

Step 7:Next, initialize the view component reference object (ViewComponentRef) in the directive as shown below −

Here,

Imported the ViewContainerRef from @angular/core module

Initialized the viewContainerRef object through contructor dependency injection. viewContainerRef is the view container of the targeted element (ng-template) in the host components template. ViewContainerRef has method to dynamically create a component and append that component to it. We will use it later in the host component to dynamically create the DynListComponent and DynTableComponent.

Step 8:Next, open the interface, DynData and add an array property, data

Step 9:Next, open the DynListComponent component and implement DynData interface.

Here,

Imported DynData interface and implements it in class definition

Included the data property as per DynData interface specification

Step 10:Next, open the components template and render the data as list of items

Here,

data hold the list of employees with two properties, name and role

Used ngFor to show the employees as list of cards

Step 11:Next, open the components styles and add necessary CSS as shown below −

Here, we used flex feature of CSS to show the employees in gallery format

Step 12:Next, open the DynTableComponent component and implement DynData interface.

Here,

Imported DynData interface and implements it in class definition

Included the data property as per DynData interface specification

Step 13:Next, open the components template and render the data as list of items

Here,

data hold the list of employees with two properties, name and role

Used ngFor to render the employees as rows in the html table

Step 14:Next, open the components styles and add necessary CSS as shown below −

Step 15:Next, open DynHostComponent components template and include the DynSampleDirective as shown below −

Here, we have shown the ng-template using our DynSample directive.

Step 16:Next, open DynHostComponent and import necessary classes

Step 17:Next, import interface, list component, table component and directive

Step 18:Implement OnInit life cycle hook in the class declaration

Step 19:Declare an input property to get format information (table / list) from user.

Step 20:Declare a property, data and set the sample data

Step 21:Declare host property and get the ng-template view component from the template by using @ViewChild and directive type, DynSampleDirective

Step 22:Do actual implementation of dynamically creating the component and loading it into the appropriate place in the ngOnInit life cycle hook

Step 23:The complete listing of the host component is as follows,

Step 24:Next, open the app components template and include the host component.

Here, we have directed the host component to render the employees data in the tabular format. The host component will dynamically create the DynTableComponent and inject into the host component template.

Step 25:Next, run the application and you can see that the employee data is shown in a tabular format as shown below −

Step 26:Next, open the app components template and change the format to gallery.

Here, we have directed the host component to render the employees data in gallery format. The host component will dynamically create the DynListComponent and inject into the host component template.

Step 27:Next, run the application and you can see that the employee data is shown in gallery format as shown below −
