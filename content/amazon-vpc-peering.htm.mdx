# Amazon VPC - Peering

URL: https://www.tutorialspoint.com/amazon-vpc/amazon-vpc-peering.htm

Amazon VPC Peeringconnection is a networking connection that allows you to establish communication between two Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs) in the AWS network.

VPC Peering connection uses private IPv4 or IPv6 addresses. This connection allows instances in different VPCs to communicate with each other as if they are in the same network. AWS allows us to create a VPC peering connection between your own VPCs or between different AWS accounts.

The following diagram shows a VPC peering connection between two Virtual Private Clouds −

VPC Peering is highly secure because the traffic between the VPCs stays within the AWS network. They do not need to traverse the public internet.

Follow the steps below to set up a VPC Peering connection −

First, sign in to AWS Management Console and then navigate to theVPC Dashboard. On the left-hand side, selectPeering Connectionsunder thePeeringsection.

Click on theCreate Peering Connectionbutton. In the form, select theRequester VPC. You also need to specify theAccepter VPC. You can choose a VPC within your AWS account or enter the VPC ID from another AWS account.

Once done, click theCreate Peering Connectionbutton.

Once the peering connection is created, go to thePeering Connectionssection in the VPC dashboard. Now, find the newly created peering connection.

Nest, select the peering connection and clickActions > Accept Request. After the request is accepted, the status will change toActive.

If the accepter VPC is in another account, the owner of the accepter VPC will need to log in to their account to accept the request.

Once the peering connection is established, we need to update the route tables in both VPCs to allow traffic to flow between them. Follow the steps below to modify the route tables:

To modify the route table, first go to theRoute Tablessection. From there, choose the route table associated with thesubnetsthat need to communicate with the other VPC.

ClickEdit Routes, then clickAdd Route. In theDestinationfield, enter theCIDR blockof the peer VPC. In theTargetfield, selectPeering Connectionand choose the relevant peering connection. Finally, to apply the changes, clickSave Routes.

Repeat the above steps in the other VPC, updating its route tables to allow traffic to flow back to the original VPC.

After modifying the Route Tables, we need to update the Security groups in both VPCs. Follow the steps given below to modify security groups −

In the VPC dashboard, go toSecurity Groups.

Select the security group associated with the resources that will communicate with the peer VPC. ClickEdit Inbound Rulesand add a rule to allow traffic from the CIDR block of the peer VPC. Similarly,edit the outbound rulesto allow traffic to the peer VPC.

To test the VPC Peering connection, try pinging an instance in the peer VPC or establish a connection.
