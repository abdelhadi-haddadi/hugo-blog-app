# PowerShell Get-FileHash

last modified February 15, 2025

In this article, we will cover the Get-FileHash cmdlet in
PowerShell. This cmdlet computes cryptographic hash values for files.

## Hash basics

A hash is a fixed-size string generated by a hash algorithm. It uniquely
represents file contents. Common hash algorithms include SHA1, SHA256, and
MD5. Hashes are used to verify file integrity and detect changes.

## Basic Get-FileHash usage

The simplest way to use Get-FileHash is with just a file path.
It defaults to SHA256 algorithm. The output includes the hash and algorithm
used. This is useful for quick file verification.

hash1.ps1
  

Get-FileHash -Path "C:\Windows\explorer.exe"

This command calculates the SHA256 hash of explorer.exe. The output shows
the hash value, algorithm, and file path.

## Specifying hash algorithm

You can specify different hash algorithms using the -Algorithm parameter.
Supported algorithms include SHA1, SHA256, SHA384, SHA512, and MD5. Each
algorithm produces different hash lengths.

hash2.ps1
  

Get-FileHash -Path "C:\Windows\explorer.exe" -Algorithm SHA512

This command calculates the SHA512 hash of explorer.exe. SHA512 produces
a longer hash than SHA256 for enhanced security.

PS C:\&gt; .\hash2.ps1

Algorithm       Hash                                                                   Path
---------       ----                                                                   ----
SHA512          E3B0C44298FC1C149AFBF4C8996FB92427AE41E4649B934CA495991B7852B855...   C:\Windows\explorer.exe

## Hashing multiple files

You can hash multiple files by using wildcards or piping file objects.
This is useful for batch processing. The output shows each file's hash
separately. You can verify multiple files at once.

hash3.ps1
  

Get-ChildItem -Path "C:\Windows\*.exe" | Get-FileHash -Algorithm MD5

This command calculates MD5 hashes for all .exe files in C:\Windows.
Each file's hash is displayed in the output.

## Comparing file hashes

You can compare file hashes to verify integrity. Store the original hash
and compare with newly calculated one. Matching hashes indicate unchanged
files. Different hashes mean the file was modified.

hash4.ps1
  

$originalHash = "A94A8FE5CCB19BA61C4C0873D391E987982FBBD3"
$currentHash = (Get-FileHash -Path "file.txt" -Algorithm SHA1).Hash
$originalHash -eq $currentHash

This script compares a stored SHA1 hash with current file hash. It returns
True if hashes match, False otherwise.

## Stream input for hashing

You can hash data from streams instead of files. Use the -InputStream
parameter with a stream object. This is useful for hashing dynamic data.
The process is similar to file hashing.

hash5.ps1
  

$data = [System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8.GetBytes("Hello World")
$stream = [System.IO.MemoryStream]::new($data)
Get-FileHash -InputStream $stream -Algorithm SHA256

This command hashes the string "Hello World" as a stream. The output shows
the SHA256 hash of the input data.

## Hashing with progress display

For large files, you can show progress during hashing. Use the -Verbose
parameter to display progress information. This helps monitor long-running
operations. The hash calculation continues in background.

hash6.ps1
  

Get-FileHash -Path "largefile.iso" -Algorithm SHA256 -Verbose

This command hashes a large file while showing progress. The verbose output
indicates the ongoing operation status.

## Exporting hash results

You can export hash results to files for documentation. Use standard output
redirection or Export-Csv cmdlet. This creates permanent records of file
hashes. Useful for security audits.

hash7.ps1
  

Get-FileHash -Path "important.dll" | Export-Csv -Path "hashes.csv" -NoTypeInformation

This command saves the hash of important.dll to a CSV file. The output file
can be used for future verification.
