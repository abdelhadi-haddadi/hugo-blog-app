# Python Match.lastgroup Attribute

last modified April 20, 2025

## Introduction to Match.lastgroup

The Match.lastgroup attribute is part of Python's re
module. It returns the name of the last matched capturing group in a regex.

This attribute is useful when working with named groups in complex patterns.
It helps identify which specific group caused the match in alternations.

If no named groups matched or the pattern has no named groups,
lastgroup returns None. It only works with
successful matches.

## Basic Syntax

The syntax for accessing Match.lastgroup is straightforward:

match.lastgroup

Here, match is a match object returned by functions like
search or match. The attribute is read-only.

## Basic Named Group Matching

Let's start with a simple example of using lastgroup with
named groups.

basic_lastgroup.py
  

#!/usr/bin/python

import re

text = "Date: 2023-12-25"
pattern = re.compile(r'(?P&lt;year&gt;\d{4})-(?P&lt;month&gt;\d{2})-(?P&lt;day&gt;\d{2})')

match = pattern.search(text)
if match:
    print(f"Last matched group name: {match.lastgroup}")
    print(f"Value: {match.group(match.lastgroup)}")

This example shows how to access the name of the last matched group.
The pattern has three named groups for date components.

pattern = re.compile(r'(?P&lt;year&gt;\d{4})-(?P&lt;month&gt;\d{2})-(?P&lt;day&gt;\d{2})')

We define a pattern with three named groups using the (?P&lt;name&gt;...)
syntax. Each group captures part of a date.

print(f"Last matched group name: {match.lastgroup}")

This prints the name of the last group that participated in the match,
which would be 'day' in this case.

## Using lastgroup with Alternation

lastgroup is particularly useful with alternation patterns.

alternation.py
  

#!/usr/bin/python

import re

texts = ["10 kg", "20 lbs", "15 stones"]
pattern = re.compile(r'(?P&lt;kg&gt;\d+\s*kg)|(?P&lt;lbs&gt;\d+\s*lbs)')

for text in texts:
    match = pattern.search(text)
    if match:
        unit = match.lastgroup
        value = match.group(unit).split()[0]
        print(f"Found {value} in {unit}")

This example demonstrates how lastgroup identifies which
unit of measurement was matched. The pattern has two alternatives.

When the input matches either 'kg' or 'lbs', lastgroup
tells us which alternative succeeded. This makes pattern analysis easier.

## Handling No Named Groups

When no named groups are present, lastgroup returns None.

no_named_groups.py
  

#!/usr/bin/python

import re

text = "The answer is 42"
pattern = re.compile(r'(\d+)')

match = pattern.search(text)
if match:
    print(f"Matched value: {match.group()}")
    print(f"Last group name: {match.lastgroup}")  # None

This shows that lastgroup returns None when
the pattern contains only unnamed groups. The match still works normally.

## Combining Named and Unnamed Groups

lastgroup only considers named groups, ignoring unnamed ones.

mixed_groups.py
  

#!/usr/bin/python

import re

text = "Color: #FF5733"
pattern = re.compile(r'Color:\s*((?P&lt;hex&gt;#[\da-fA-F]{6})|(?P&lt;rgb&gt;rgb\(\d+,\d+,\d+\)))')

match = pattern.search(text)
if match:
    print(f"Matched format: {match.lastgroup}")  # 'hex'
    print(f"Full match: {match.group()}")

Here we have a pattern with both named and unnamed groups.
lastgroup correctly identifies the named group that matched.

## Multiple Matches and lastgroup

When using finditer, each match has its own lastgroup.

multiple_matches.py
  

#!/usr/bin/python

import re

text = "10kg 20lbs 15kg 30lbs"
pattern = re.compile(r'(?P&lt;kg&gt;\d+kg)|(?P&lt;lbs&gt;\d+lbs)')

for match in pattern.finditer(text):
    print(f"Value: {match.group()}, Unit: {match.lastgroup}")

This example processes multiple matches in text. Each match object
maintains its own lastgroup information.

The output shows which unit was matched for each value in the input string.
This is useful for processing mixed-format data.

## Complex Pattern with Nested Groups

lastgroup works correctly even with nested group structures.

nested_groups.py
  

#!/usr/bin/python

import re

text = "Product: Laptop (Model: XPS-15)"
pattern = re.compile(r'Product:\s*(?P&lt;type&gt;\w+)\s*(\(Model:\s*(?P&lt;model&gt;[\w-]+)\))?')

match = pattern.search(text)
if match:
    print(f"Last matched group: {match.lastgroup}")  # 'model'
    print(f"Product type: {match.group('type')}")
    print(f"Model: {match.group('model')}")

This demonstrates that lastgroup correctly identifies the
deepest named group that participated in the match.

## Best Practices

When using Match.lastgroup, consider these best practices:

- Use meaningful names for groups to make lastgroup more useful

- Check for None when patterns might match unnamed groups

- Combine with groupdict for comprehensive match analysis

- Prefer named groups when using alternations for better debugging

- Document group names in complex patterns for maintainability

## Performance Considerations

Accessing lastgroup has minimal performance impact as the
information is stored during the match process. It doesn't require
additional pattern processing.

However, using many named groups in complex patterns may slightly
increase memory usage. This tradeoff is usually worth the improved
code clarity.
