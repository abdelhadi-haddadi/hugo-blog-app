# Advanced wxPython tutorial

![pixel.gif](images/pixel.gif)

The e-book has 233 pages. It has 94
code examples. Many of the examples are unique; a reader
will not find them anywhere else. It is an ideal material 
for those who already know some basics of wxPython library. 
Carefully chosen examples always focus on one important
aspect. (Unless it is a more complex example.) The e-book is
written in plain English.

The code examples were tested on Linux and Windows. 
Python 3.8.1 and wxPython 4.1.1 on Windows 10. Python 3.9.5 and wxPython 4.1.1 on
Linux. After purchasing the e-book, you will obtain a ZIP file.
With the PDF file, you will also obtain all code examples.

## About this tutorial

This is Advanced wxPython e-book. This e-book is a tutorial,
which covers several interesting parts of the library.

This e-book covers the following:

  - Cairo graphics library

  - Layout management

  - Images

  - Custom widgets

  - Advanced widgets

  - Snake

  - Sokoban

  - Minesweeper

The first chapter presents the *Cairo* graphics library.
We work with colours, shapes, and gradients. Reflection, star animation,
aliens example are among other code examples.

Layout management is considered to be one of the most difficult areas of GUI
programming. Writers usually only skim the topic, covering the very basics of
it. Based on my experience while writing a complete e-book dedicated to 
layout management, this chapter was a piece of cake. Once you know the principles
behind the process, you can utilize them in other GUI toolkits too.

The third chapter is dedicated to images. In this chapter, we show how to
scale or crop the image, create a grayscale image, a watermark, or create an
application which takes a screenshot.

In the fourth chapter, we show how to create three custom widgets: a ProgressMeter widget,
a Thermometer widget and a ColourWheel widget.

The fifth chapter covers advanced widgets; we have plenty of examples
covering the wx.TextCtrl, wx.ListCtrl, wx.TreeCtrl, 
wx.Grid, and the wx.richtext.RichText.

One of the best ways to learn programming is to create computer games. As a bonus,
you will have three simple 2D games: Snake, Sokoban, and Minesweeper.
