# Tcl exit Command

last modified April 3, 2025

The Tcl exit command is used to terminate a Tcl script or application.
It immediately stops script execution and returns control to the operating system.

## Basic Definition

The exit command terminates the Tcl interpreter with an optional exit
code. By default, it returns 0 indicating successful termination.

Syntax: exit ?returnCode?. The optional returnCode is an integer
that indicates the exit status to the calling process.

## Basic Exit Command

This shows the simplest usage of exit to terminate a script.

basic_exit.tcl
  

puts "Starting script..."
exit
puts "This line will never be executed"

The script prints the first message and then terminates. The second message
after exit is never reached. This demonstrates the immediate
nature of the command.

## Exit with Status Code

The exit command can return a status code to the calling process.

exit_status.tcl
  

set success 0
set failure 1

if {[file exists "data.txt"]} {
    puts "File exists"
    exit $success
} else {
    puts "File not found"
    exit $failure
}

This script checks for a file's existence and exits with different status codes.
Status 0 typically means success, while non-zero indicates an error condition.

## Conditional Exit

exit can be used with conditional statements to control program flow.

conditional_exit.tcl
  

set input [gets stdin]

if {$input eq "quit"} {
    puts "Exiting program..."
    exit
}

puts "You entered: $input"

This script reads user input and exits if the input is "quit". Otherwise, it
echoes the input back. This pattern is common in interactive programs.

## Exit in Procedures

The exit command can be called from within Tcl procedures.

exit_proc.tcl
  

proc check_args {args} {
    if {[llength $args] == 0} {
        puts "Error: No arguments provided"
        exit 1
    }
    puts "Processing arguments..."
}

check_args
puts "This won't be printed"

This demonstrates how exit terminates the entire script, even when
called from a procedure. The procedure checks for arguments and exits if none
are provided.

## Exit with Error Message

Combine exit with error messages for better diagnostics.

exit_error.tcl
  

set required_version 8.6

if {[info tclversion] &lt; $required_version} {
    puts stderr "Error: Requires Tcl $required_version or higher"
    exit 1
}

puts "Running with Tcl [info tclversion]"

This script checks the Tcl version and exits with an error message if the
version is too old. The message is printed to stderr for proper error handling.

## Graceful Shutdown

Use exit with cleanup operations for graceful termination.

exit_cleanup.tcl
  

proc cleanup {} {
    puts "Performing cleanup operations..."
    # Close files, release resources, etc.
}

proc main {} {
    puts "Starting main operations..."
    after 1000
    cleanup
    exit 0
}

main

This example shows a pattern for graceful shutdown. The cleanup
procedure is called before exit to ensure proper resource management.

## Best Practices

- **Status Codes:** Use standard exit codes (0=success, non-zero=error).

- **Cleanup:** Perform necessary cleanup before exiting.

- **Messages:** Provide informative messages for error exits.

- **Conditionals:** Use exit in conditional blocks for flow control.

- **Testing:** Test exit conditions thoroughly in your scripts.
