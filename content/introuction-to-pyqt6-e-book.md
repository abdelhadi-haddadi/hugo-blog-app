The e-book has 158 pages. It has 97 code examples. Many of the
examples are unique. Carefully chosen examples always focus on one important
aspect. The book is written in plain English.

The code examples were tested on Linux and Windows, Python 3.8.1 and PyQt5
5.15.0 on Windows 10 and Python 3.9.5 and PyQt 5.15.4 on Debian Linux. After
purchasing the e-book, you will obtain a ZIP file. With the PDF file, you will
also obtain all code examples.

## About this e-book

This is Introduction to PyQt6 e-book. This e-book is an introductory tutorial
for beginners.

This e-book covers the following:

  - Basics

  - Date and time

  - QMainWindow

  - Layout management

  - Events

  - Widgets

  - Graphics

  - Minesweeper

In the first chapter, we create our first programs. We create a simple window, 
define a shortcut, work with stylesheets or tooltips.
The second chapter covers date and time. The examples demonstrate date
and time arithmetic, show how to work with universal and local time,
epochs, or daylight saving time.

The QMainWindow chapter covers the main application window. We learn how to
create menus and toolbars. In the Layout Management chapter, we show how to use
built-in layout management classes to lay out our widgets on the window. 

The Events chapter focuses on application event management. We define events,
the events and signals framework, and show to connect event handlers to various
events.

In the Widgets chapter we cover basic UI widgets, including labels, buttons, 
sliders, and line edits.

In the Graphics chapter, we do some basic and more advanced painting.
In the last chapter of this e-book, we create a simple clone
of the Minesweeper game.

Layout management is considered to be one of the most difficult areas of GUI
programming. Writers usually only skim the topic, covering the very basics of
it. Based on my experience while writing a complete e-book dedicated to layout
management, this chapter was a piece of cake. Once you know the principles
behind the process, you can utilize them in other GUI toolkits too. In this
chapter you will learn everything important about layout management.
