# VBScript BuildPath Method

last modified April 9, 2025

The BuildPath method in VBScript is part of the
FileSystemObject. It combines a base path with a relative path into
a single path string. This method automatically handles path separators, making
path concatenation more reliable. It's commonly used in file operations and
directory management.

BuildPath ensures proper path construction regardless of trailing
backslashes. It simplifies script development by handling path separator logic
automatically. This tutorial covers BuildPath with practical
examples to demonstrate its usage.

## BuildPath Method Overview

The BuildPath method takes two parameters: an existing path and a
name to append. It returns a string combining these paths with the appropriate
separator. The method is available through the FileSystemObject in
VBScript scripting.

Key features include automatic backslash handling and platform-appropriate
separators. It doesn't verify path existence or validity. BuildPath
works with both file and directory paths. Understanding this method helps create
robust file handling scripts.

## Basic Path Combination

This example demonstrates the simplest use of BuildPath to combine
two path components. It shows how the method automatically inserts the correct
separator. The base path and additional name are combined into a complete path.

basic_buildpath.vbs
  

Set fso = CreateObject("Scripting.FileSystemObject")
combinedPath = fso.BuildPath("C:\Documents", "Reports")
WScript.Echo combinedPath ' Output: C:\Documents\Reports

Set fso = Nothing

The script creates a FileSystemObject and calls
BuildPath. The base path "C:\Documents" is combined with "Reports".
The result is "C:\Documents\Reports". Notice the automatic backslash insertion
between components.

## Handling Trailing Backslashes

BuildPath correctly handles cases where the base path ends with a backslash. 
This example shows how the method avoids duplicate separators. It demonstrates 
consistent behavior regardless of trailing backslashes.

trailing_backslash.vbs
  

Set fso = CreateObject("Scripting.FileSystemObject")
path1 = fso.BuildPath("C:\Temp\", "file.txt")
path2 = fso.BuildPath("C:\Temp", "file.txt")

WScript.Echo path1 ' Output: C:\Temp\file.txt
WScript.Echo path2 ' Output: C:\Temp\file.txt

Set fso = Nothing

Both path1 and path2 produce identical results despite different base paths. 
BuildPath normalizes the output by handling the trailing backslash
properly. This consistency makes path construction more reliable in scripts.

## Building Nested Directory Paths

BuildPath can create complex nested directory paths by chaining
calls. This example shows how to construct multi-level directory structures.
Each BuildPath 
call adds another level to the path hierarchy.

nested_paths.vbs
  

Set fso = CreateObject("Scripting.FileSystemObject")
basePath = "C:\Projects"
level1 = fso.BuildPath(basePath, "Website")
level2 = fso.BuildPath(level1, "Images")
level3 = fso.BuildPath(level2, "Products")

WScript.Echo level3 ' Output: C:\Projects\Website\Images\Products

Set fso = Nothing

The script builds a path to "C:\Projects\Website\Images\Products". Each 
BuildPath call extends the path further. This approach is cleaner
than manual string concatenation with backslashes.

## Combining Drive Root with Path

This example demonstrates combining a drive root with subsequent path
components. It shows BuildPath working with the minimal base path
of just a drive letter. The method correctly handles the drive root case.

drive_root.vbs
  

Set fso = CreateObject("Scripting.FileSystemObject")
drivePath = fso.BuildPath("D:", "DataFiles")
fullPath = fso.BuildPath(drivePath, "Archive")

WScript.Echo fullPath ' Output: D:\DataFiles\Archive

Set fso = Nothing

The script starts with just "D:" as the base path. BuildPath
correctly converts this to "D:\" when combining. The result is a properly
formatted full path with all necessary separators included.

## Creating File Paths from Components

BuildPath can combine directory paths with filenames to create
complete file paths. This example shows constructing a file path from separate
directory and filename components. It's useful for file operations.

file_path.vbs
  

Set fso = CreateObject("Scripting.FileSystemObject")
dirPath = "C:\Users\Public\Documents"
fileName = "report.docx"
filePath = fso.BuildPath(dirPath, fileName)

WScript.Echo filePath ' Output: C:\Users\Public\Documents\report.docx

Set fso = Nothing

The directory path and filename are combined into a complete file path. This
approach is safer than manual concatenation. BuildPath ensures
proper separator usage regardless of the directory path's ending.
