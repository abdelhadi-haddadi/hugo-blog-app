# Perl join Function

last modified April 4, 2025

The Perl join function combines list elements into a single string.
It takes a separator and a list, returning the concatenated result.

join is the opposite of split and is essential for
string construction. It's efficient and works with any list-like data.

## Basic join Usage

The simplest way to use join is with a separator and array.

basic.pl
  

#!/usr/bin/perl

use strict;
use warnings;
use v5.34.0;

my @words = ('apple', 'banana', 'cherry');
my $result = join(', ', @words);

print "Joined string: $result\n";

We join three fruits with a comma and space separator. The function
combines array elements into one string.

$ ./basic.pl
Joined string: apple, banana, cherry

## Joining with Empty Separator

An empty separator concatenates elements without any characters between.

empty.pl
  

#!/usr/bin/perl

use strict;
use warnings;
use v5.34.0;

my @numbers = (1, 2, 3, 4);
my $combined = join('', @numbers);

print "Combined: $combined\n";
print "Length: ", length($combined), "\n";

This joins numbers directly together. The result is a single string of digits.

$ ./empty.pl
Combined: 1234
Length: 4

## Joining with Newlines

Using newline as separator creates multi-line strings from lists.

newlines.pl
  

#!/usr/bin/perl

use strict;
use warnings;
use v5.34.0;

my @lines = ('First line', 'Second line', 'Third line');
my $text = join("\n", @lines);

print "Result:\n$text\n";

Each array element becomes a separate line. This is useful for file output.

$ ./newlines.pl
Result:
First line
Second line
Third line

## Joining Hash Values

join can combine hash values after extracting them.

hash.pl
  

#!/usr/bin/perl

use strict;
use warnings;
use v5.34.0;

my %fruit_colors = (
    apple  =&gt; 'red',
    banana =&gt; 'yellow',
    grape  =&gt; 'purple'
);

my $color_list = join(', ', values %fruit_colors);
print "Fruit colors: $color_list\n";

We extract hash values with values then join them. The order
of values is unpredictable.

$ ./hash.pl
Fruit colors: yellow, red, purple

## Complex Separators

Separators can be multi-character strings for complex formatting.

complex.pl
  

#!/usr/bin/perl

use strict;
use warnings;
use v5.34.0;

my @items = ('CPU', 'RAM', 'SSD', 'GPU');
my $separator = " | ";
my $specs = join($separator, @items);

print "Computer specs:\n$specs\n";

The pipe separator with spaces creates a readable list. This is common in
console output.

$ ./complex.pl
Computer specs:
CPU | RAM | SSD | GPU

## Joining with Variables

Variables can be used both as separators and list elements.

variables.pl
  

#!/usr/bin/perl

use strict;
use warnings;
use v5.34.0;

my $user = 'admin';
my $domain = 'example.com';
my $separator = '@';

my $email = join($separator, $user, $domain);
print "Email: $email\n";

We construct an email address by joining username and domain. Variables
provide flexibility.

$ ./variables.pl
Email: admin@example.com

## Joining Split Results

join often pairs with split for string processing.

splitjoin.pl
  

#!/usr/bin/perl

use strict;
use warnings;
use v5.34.0;

my $csv = "one,two,three,four";
my @parts = split(',', $csv);
my $new_csv = join(';', @parts);

print "Original: $csv\n";
print "Modified: $new_csv\n";

We split a CSV string then rejoin with different separators. This is common
in data conversion.

$ ./splitjoin.pl
Original: one,two,three,four
Modified: one;two;three;four

## Best Practices

- **Choose clear separators:** Make joined strings readable.

- **Pre-allocate for performance:** Use join instead of concatenation in loops.

- **Combine with map/grep:** Process elements before joining.

- **Watch for undef:** Undefined elements become empty strings.
