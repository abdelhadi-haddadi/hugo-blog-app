# Tkinter programming e-book

![pixel.gif](images/pixel.gif)

The e-book has 197 pages. It has 89 code examples. 
It covers GUI development in Tkinter with Python. It is an ideal material 
for those who already know basics of the Python language and want to
learn about GUI programming. Carefully chosen examples always focus on 
one important aspect. (Unless it is a more complex example.)  Buying this e-book
you will save a lot of hours searching on the Internet, asking on 
forums and figuring things on your own. What took the author 
months and weeks to find out, you will get in days and hours.
The e-book is written in plain English.

The code examples were tested on Linux and Windows:
Python 3.8 and Tk 8.6 on Windows 10 and Ubuntu Linux. 
After purchasing the e-book, you will be redirected to
a page where you can download a ZIP file. 
With the PDF file, you will also obtain all code examples.

## About this tutorial

This is Tkinter programming e-book. This e-book is an introductory 
tutorial, which teaches basics and intermediate topics. It is 
based on ZetCode's Tkinter tutorial with additional material.

The e-book has 9 chapters. The complete [table of contents](#contents) 
is listed at the end of the page.

The following is covered:

  - Introduction

  - Layout management

  - Events

  - Widgets

  - Menus and toolbars

  - Listbox

  - Text

  - Treeview

  - Canvas

The *Introduction* chapter introduces Tkinter and explains some 
fundamentals of the toolkit. The *Layout management* chapter explains 
the layout management of Tkinter widgets. This area is considered to 
be one of the most difficult areas of GUI programming. Therefore, this 
e-book gives particular emphasis on the layout management process.

The *Events* chapter is an in-depth coverage of the event handling 
system of Tkinter. The *Widgets* chapter covers 17 Tkinter widgets;
each widget has a small working example. In the *Menus and toolbars* 
chapter, we show how to work with menus and toolbars. 

The *Listbox* chapter is dedicated to the listbox widget. 
The *Text* chapter covers the text widget in a detail; it contains
9 examples including searching for text and spell checking. 
The *Treeview* widget dedicates 9 examples to the treeview 
widget. In the *Canvas* chapter we do some drawing. 
At the end of the chapter, we create an Arkanoid game.
