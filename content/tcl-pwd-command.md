# Tcl pwd Command

last modified April 3, 2025

The Tcl pwd command returns the current working directory. It's a
fundamental command for file system navigation in Tcl scripts. The command is
particularly useful when working with file operations.

## Basic Definition

The pwd command stands for "print working directory". It returns
the absolute path of the current working directory as a string. This is the
directory where the Tcl script is currently operating.

Syntax: pwd. The command takes no arguments and always returns the
full path to the current working directory. The path format is system-dependent.

## Basic pwd Usage

This example demonstrates the simplest usage of the pwd command.

basic_pwd.tcl
  

set current_dir [pwd]
puts "Current directory: $current_dir"

This captures the current working directory in a variable and prints it. The
pwd command is called within square brackets for command substitution.

## Comparing Directories

The pwd output can be compared with other directory paths.

compare_dirs.tcl
  

set home_dir "/home/user"
if {[pwd] eq $home_dir} {
    puts "You're in your home directory"
} else {
    puts "Current directory: [pwd]"
}

This script compares the current directory with a predefined home directory. The
eq operator performs string comparison. Different actions are taken
based on the comparison result.

## Using pwd with File Operations

pwd is often used with file operations to create absolute paths.

file_operations.tcl
  

set filename "data.txt"
set full_path [file join [pwd] $filename]
puts "Full path to file: $full_path"

This combines the current directory with a filename using file join.
The result is a platform-independent path to the file. This technique ensures
scripts work across different operating systems.

## Changing and Restoring Directory

This example shows how to temporarily change directories while remembering the
original location.

change_restore.tcl
  

set original_dir [pwd]
cd /tmp
puts "Now in: [pwd]"
cd $original_dir
puts "Restored to: [pwd]"

The script stores the original directory, changes to /tmp, then returns. This
pattern is useful when scripts need to operate in different directories. Always
restore the original directory when done.

## pwd in Procedures

The pwd command can be used within procedures to get the current
directory at any point.

proc_pwd.tcl
  

proc show_dir {} {
    puts "Procedure executing in: [pwd]"
}

puts "Script starts in: [pwd]"
cd /var
show_dir

This demonstrates that pwd reflects the current directory at call
time, not definition time. The procedure shows the directory where it's called,
which may differ from where it was defined.

## Error Handling with pwd

While pwd rarely fails, it's good practice to handle potential errors.

error_handling.tcl
  

if {[catch {set current_dir [pwd]} err]} {
    puts "Error getting current directory: $err"
} else {
    puts "Current directory: $current_dir"
}

This uses catch to handle any potential errors from pwd.
While unlikely, directory access might fail due to permissions or other system
issues. Robust scripts should account for such possibilities.

## Best Practices

- **Absolute Paths:** Use pwd to create absolute paths for reliability.

- **Directory Changes:** Always store original directory when changing.

- **Error Handling:** Consider wrapping pwd in catch for robustness.

- **Platform Independence:** Use file join with pwd for cross-platform paths.

- **Logging:** Log current directory in scripts for debugging.

showing its usage in different scenarios. The command is essential for file
system navigation in Tcl scripts.
