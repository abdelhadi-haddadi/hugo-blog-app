# Tcl auto_reset Command

last modified April 3, 2025

The Tcl auto_reset command controls automatic reset behavior in Tcl.
It determines whether unknown commands trigger an automatic reset of the
interpreter. This is useful for security and debugging purposes.

## Basic Definition

The auto_reset command enables or disables automatic reset when
an unknown command is encountered. By default, this feature is enabled in Tcl.

Syntax: auto_reset ?boolean?. With no arguments, it returns the
current setting. With a boolean argument, it sets the auto-reset behavior.

## Checking Current auto_reset Setting

This example shows how to check the current auto_reset setting in your Tcl
interpreter.

check_auto_reset.tcl
  

set current_setting [auto_reset]
puts "Current auto_reset setting: $current_setting"

This code retrieves the current auto_reset setting and prints it. The default
value is typically 1 (enabled) in most Tcl installations.

## Disabling auto_reset

This example demonstrates how to disable the auto_reset feature in Tcl.

disable_auto_reset.tcl
  

auto_reset 0
puts "auto_reset is now disabled"

After running this code, the interpreter won't automatically reset when it
encounters unknown commands. This can be useful for debugging scripts.

## Enabling auto_reset

This example shows how to enable the auto_reset feature if it was previously
disabled.

enable_auto_reset.tcl
  

auto_reset 1
puts "auto_reset is now enabled"

Enabling auto_reset provides security by preventing execution of unknown
commands. The interpreter will reset instead of trying to execute them.

## Testing auto_reset Behavior

This example demonstrates the difference in behavior when auto_reset is
enabled versus disabled.

test_auto_reset.tcl
  

# First with auto_reset enabled
auto_reset 1
puts "Testing with auto_reset enabled"
catch {unknown_command} result
puts "Result: $result"

# Then with auto_reset disabled
auto_reset 0
puts "\nTesting with auto_reset disabled"
catch {unknown_command} result
puts "Result: $result"

The script shows how the interpreter handles unknown commands differently
based on the auto_reset setting. The catch command prevents
errors from stopping execution.

## auto_reset in Safe Interpreters

This example shows how auto_reset behaves differently in safe interpreters.

safe_interp_auto_reset.tcl
  

set safe_interp [interp create -safe]
interp eval $safe_interp {
    puts "Safe interpreter auto_reset: [auto_reset]"
    auto_reset 0
    puts "After attempting to disable: [auto_reset]"
}
interp delete $safe_interp

In safe interpreters, the auto_reset setting is typically forced to be on
for security reasons. Attempts to disable it will have no effect.

## Combining auto_reset with Unknown Handler

This advanced example shows how auto_reset interacts with a custom unknown
command handler.

auto_reset_unknown_handler.tcl
  

proc unknown {args} {
    puts "Custom unknown handler called with: $args"
    return "Handled unknown command"
}

auto_reset 0
puts [nonexistent_command 1 2 3]

auto_reset 1
catch {puts [nonexistent_command 1 2 3]} result
puts "With auto_reset 1: $result"

When auto_reset is disabled, the custom unknown handler processes unknown
commands. When enabled, the interpreter resets instead of using the handler.

## Best Practices

- **Security:** Keep auto_reset enabled in production for security.

- **Debugging:** Temporarily disable for debugging unknown commands.

- **Safe Interpreters:** Remember it can't be disabled in safe interpreters.

- **Testing:** Always test behavior changes in a controlled environment.

- **Documentation:** Document when you change this setting in your code.
