# Java Comparable Interface

Last modified: April 13, 2025

 

The java.lang.Comparable interface defines the *natural ordering*
of objects in Java. It provides a single method, compareTo, which
must be implemented by any class that requires sorting. Implementing this
interface allows objects to be compared against one another based on a defined
sorting logic.

By implementing Comparable, instances of a class gain 
*automatic sorting capabilities*, meaning they can be arranged in order
using methods like Collections.sort or stored in sorted collections
such as TreeSet and TreeMap. This ensures consistent
behavior across different sorting mechanisms.

## Comparable Interface Definition

The Comparable interface is simple, containing only one method that
determines the relative order of objects:

public interface Comparable&lt;T&gt; {
    int compareTo(T o);

The generic type parameter T specifies the type of objects that the
implementing class can compare itself against. The compareTo method
compares the current object with another object of the same type and returns:

    - A negative integer if the current object is less than the specified object.

    - Zero if both objects are equal in terms of ordering.

    - A positive integer if the current object is greater than the specified object.

## Usage in Sorting

Classes that implement Comparable must define their sorting logic
inside compareTo. For example, sorting a list of custom objects
like Person based on age would require overriding
compareTo as follows:

class Person implements Comparable&lt;Person&gt; {
    private int age;

    public Person(int age) {
        this.age = age;
    }

    @Override
    public int compareTo(Person other) {
        return Integer.compare(this.age, other.age);
    }

This ensures that sorting a collection of Person objects will
arrange them in ascending order based on age. The Comparable
interface is widely used in scenarios requiring default sorting logic for
objects, such as sorting lists, maintaining ordered data structures, and
simplifying comparisons.

## Basic Comparable Implementation

Let's start with a simple example of implementing Comparable for a Person
class. We'll compare Person objects based on their age.

Main.java
  

class Person implements Comparable&lt;Person&gt; {

    private String name;
    private int age;
    
    public Person(String name, int age) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
    }
    
    @Override
    public int compareTo(Person other) {
        return this.age - other.age;
    }
    
    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return name + " (" + age + ")";
    }
}

void main() {

    List&lt;Person&gt; people = Arrays.asList(
        new Person("Alice", 30),
        new Person("Bob", 25),
        new Person("Charlie", 35)
    );
    
    Collections.sort(people);
    System.out.println("Sorted by age: " + people);
}

In this example, Person implements Comparable&lt;Person&gt; and defines natural
ordering by age. The compareTo method subtracts the other person's
age from this person's age. Collections.sort uses this to sort the list.

## String Comparison with Comparable

Strings in Java already implement Comparable, allowing them to be sorted
alphabetically. Here's how String's natural ordering works.

Main.java
  

void main() {

    List&lt;String&gt; names = Arrays.asList(
        "Zoe", "Alice", "Bob", "Charlie", "David"
    );
    
    Collections.sort(names);
    System.out.println("Sorted names: " + names);
    
    // Demonstrating compareTo directly
    System.out.println("\"Alice\".compareTo(\"Bob\"): " + 
                        "Alice".compareTo("Bob"));
}

This example shows String's natural ordering. The list is sorted alphabetically.
The direct compareTo call shows that "Alice" comes before "Bob"
lexicographically, returning a negative number.

## Comparing Multiple Fields

When comparing objects, we often need to consider multiple fields. Here's how
to implement more complex comparison logic.

Main.java
  

class Student implements Comparable&lt;Student&gt; {

    private String name;
    private int grade;
    private double gpa;
    
    public Student(String name, int grade, double gpa) {
        this.name = name;
        this.grade = grade;
        this.gpa = gpa;
    }
    
    @Override
    public int compareTo(Student other) {

        // First compare by grade
        int gradeCompare = Integer.compare(this.grade, other.grade);
        if (gradeCompare != 0) {
            return gradeCompare;
        }
        
        // If grades are equal, compare by GPA (descending)
        int gpaCompare = Double.compare(other.gpa, this.gpa);
        if (gpaCompare != 0) {
            return gpaCompare;
        }
        
        // If GPA also equal, compare by name
        return this.name.compareTo(other.name);
    }
    
    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return name + " (Grade " + grade + ", GPA " + gpa + ")";
    }
}

void main() {

    List&lt;Student&gt; students = Arrays.asList(
        new Student("Alice", 10, 3.8),
        new Student("Bob", 10, 3.9),
        new Student("Charlie", 9, 4.0),
        new Student("David", 10, 3.9)
    );
    
    Collections.sort(students);
    System.out.println("Sorted students:");
    students.forEach(System.out::println);
}

This Student class compares first by grade (ascending), then by GPA (descending),
and finally by name (ascending). The example shows how to implement multi-field
comparisons in a clear, maintainable way.

## Comparable with Custom Objects

Here's another example with a Product class that implements
Comparable based on price and then name.

Main.java
  

class Product implements Comparable&lt;Product&gt; {

    private String name;
    private double price;
    
    public Product(String name, double price) {
        this.name = name;
        this.price = price;
    }
    
    @Override
    public int compareTo(Product other) {
        int priceCompare = Double.compare(this.price, other.price);
        if (priceCompare != 0) {
            return priceCompare;
        }
        return this.name.compareTo(other.name);
    }
    
    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return name + " ($" + price + ")";
    }
}

void main() {

    List&lt;Product&gt; products = Arrays.asList(

        new Product("Laptop", 999.99),
        new Product("Phone", 699.99),
        new Product("Tablet", 399.99),
        new Product("Headphones", 99.99),
        new Product("Mouse", 19.99),
        new Product("Keyboard", 99.99),
        new Product("Smartwatch", 399.99),
        new Product("Monitor", 699.99)
    );
    
    Collections.sort(products);
    System.out.println("Products sorted by price:");
    products.forEach(System.out::println);
}

The Product class compares first by price (ascending) and then by name
(ascending). This ensures consistent ordering even when products have the same
price. The example demonstrates sorting a list of products by their natural
order.

## Reverse Natural Ordering

Sometimes we need to sort in reverse of the natural order. Here's how to do it
using Collections.reverseOrder().

Main.java
  

void main() {

    List&lt;Integer&gt; numbers = Arrays.asList(5, 2, 8, 1, 3, 9, 4);
    
    // Natural order (ascending)
    Collections.sort(numbers);
    System.out.println("Natural order: " + numbers);
    
    // Reverse natural order (descending)
    Collections.sort(numbers, Collections.reverseOrder());
    System.out.println("Reverse order: " + numbers);
    
    // Strings in reverse alphabetical order
    List&lt;String&gt; words = Arrays.asList("apple", "banana", "cherry", "date");
    Collections.sort(words, Collections.reverseOrder());
    System.out.println("Reverse alphabetical: " + words);
}

This example shows how to sort in reverse of the natural order using
Collections.reverseOrder. It works with any Comparable
type, including Integer and String. The comparator
returned by reverseOrder simply inverts the result of the natural
comparison.

## Comparable with LocalDate Objects

Java's LocalDate class implements Comparable, enabling
natural chronological ordering for date values. Here's an example demonstrating
how to sort a list of dates using LocalDate.

Main.java
  

void main() {

    List&lt;LocalDate&gt; dates = Arrays.asList(
        LocalDate.parse("2023-05-15"),
        LocalDate.parse("2023-01-10"),
        LocalDate.parse("2023-03-20"),
        LocalDate.parse("2023-11-05")
    );

    System.out.println("Original dates:");
    dates.forEach(System.out::println);

    Collections.sort(dates);

    System.out.println("\nSorted dates:");
    dates.forEach(System.out::println);
}

This example demonstrates LocalDate's natural ordering, which
follows chronological order. Dates are parsed from strings, stored in a list,
and sorted using Collections.sort. The output displays dates in
ascending order.

## Comparable vs Comparator

While Comparable defines natural ordering, Comparator
provides external comparison logic. Here's an example showing both approaches.

Main.java
  

class Employee implements Comparable&lt;Employee&gt; {

    private String name;
    private int id;
    private String department;
    
    public Employee(String name, int id, String department) {
        this.name = name;
        this.id = id;
        this.department = department;
    }
    
    // Natural ordering by ID
    @Override
    public int compareTo(Employee other) {
        return Integer.compare(this.id, other.id);
    }
    
    public String getName() { return name; }
    public int getId() { return id; }
    public String getDepartment() { return department; }
    
    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return name + " (ID: " + id + ", Dept: " + department + ")";
    }
}

void main() {

    List&lt;Employee&gt; employees = Arrays.asList(
        new Employee("Alice", 103, "HR"),
        new Employee("Bob", 101, "IT"),
        new Employee("Charlie", 102, "Finance")
    );
    
    // Sort using natural order (by ID)
    Collections.sort(employees);
    System.out.println("Sorted by ID (natural order):");
    employees.forEach(System.out::println);
    
    // Sort using Comparator (by name)
    Collections.sort(employees, Comparator.comparing(Employee::getName));
    System.out.println("\nSorted by name (using Comparator):");
    employees.forEach(System.out::println);
}

This example shows both approaches. Employee implements Comparable
for natural ordering by ID. We also demonstrate sorting by name using a
Comparator lambda. Comparable is for primary ordering,
while Comparator provides alternative ordering options.
