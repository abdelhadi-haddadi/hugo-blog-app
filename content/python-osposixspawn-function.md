# Python os.posix_spawn Function

Last modified April 11, 2025

This comprehensive guide explores Python's os.posix_spawn function,
a POSIX-compliant process creation mechanism. We'll cover file actions, spawn
attributes, and practical examples for efficient process spawning.

## Basic Definitions

The os.posix_spawn function creates a new process executing a
specified program. It's more efficient than fork-exec on some systems.

Key parameters: path (program to execute), argv (argument list), env (environment),
file_actions (file operations), and spawn attributes (process characteristics).

## Basic Process Creation

The simplest use of os.posix_spawn launches a program with given
arguments. This example runs the 'ls' command to list directory contents.

basic_spawn.py
  

import os

# Basic process creation
pid = os.posix_spawn(
    "/bin/ls",
    ["ls", "-l", "/tmp"],
    os.environ
)

# Wait for the process to complete
_, status = os.waitpid(pid, 0)
print(f"Process {pid} exited with status {status}")

This creates a new process running 'ls -l /tmp'. The parent waits for the child
to complete using os.waitpid. The environment is inherited from the parent.

Note that the first argument in argv should match the program name (convention).

## Custom Environment Variables

You can specify custom environment variables when spawning a process. This
example sets a special environment for the child process.

custom_env.py
  

import os

# Create custom environment
custom_env = os.environ.copy()
custom_env["MODE"] = "DEBUG"
custom_env["LOG_LEVEL"] = "VERBOSE"

# Spawn process with custom environment
pid = os.posix_spawn(
    "/usr/bin/env",
    ["env"],
    custom_env
)

# Wait for process
_, status = os.waitpid(pid, 0)
print(f"Process completed with status {status}")

The child process runs 'env' which displays its environment. We see our custom
variables MODE and LOG_LEVEL in the output.

Environment variables are passed as a dictionary. Always copy os.environ first
to avoid modifying the parent's environment.

## File Actions - Redirecting Output

File actions allow modifying file descriptors before program execution. This
example redirects stdout to a file.

redirect_output.py
  

import os

# Prepare file actions
file_actions = os.posix_spawn_file_actions()
file_actions.addopen(1, "output.txt", os.O_WRONLY | os.O_CREAT, 0o644)
file_actions.addclose(2)  # Close stderr

# Spawn process with file actions
pid = os.posix_spawn(
    "/bin/ls",
    ["ls", "-l", "/"],
    os.environ,
    file_actions=file_actions
)

os.waitpid(pid, 0)
print("Output written to output.txt")

This redirects stdout (fd 1) to output.txt and closes stderr (fd 2). The ls
output goes to the file instead of the terminal.

File actions must be created before spawning and can include open, close,
and dup2 operations.

## Spawn Attributes - Process Group

Spawn attributes control process characteristics. This example creates a new
process group for the child process.

process_group.py
  

import os

# Prepare spawn attributes
spawn_attrs = os.posix_spawnattr()
spawn_attrs.setflags(os.POSIX_SPAWN_SETPGROUP)
spawn_attrs.setpgroup(0)  # Create new process group

# Spawn process with attributes
pid = os.posix_spawn(
    "/bin/sleep",
    ["sleep", "10"],
    os.environ,
    spawn_attrs=spawn_attrs
)

print(f"Created process {pid} in new process group")
os.waitpid(pid, 0)

The child process (sleep) runs in its own process group. This is useful for
process management and signal handling.

Attributes can control signal handling, scheduling, and other process
characteristics.

## Combining File Actions and Attributes

This example demonstrates using both file actions and spawn attributes to
create a process with customized characteristics.

combined_features.py
  

import os

# File actions - redirect stdout/stderr
file_actions = os.posix_spawn_file_actions()
file_actions.addopen(1, "out.log", os.O_WRONLY | os.O_CREAT, 0o644)
file_actions.adddup2(1, 2)  # Redirect stderr to stdout

# Spawn attributes - new process group
spawn_attrs = os.posix_spawnattr()
spawn_attrs.setflags(os.POSIX_SPAWN_SETPGROUP)
spawn_attrs.setpgroup(0)

# Spawn process
pid = os.posix_spawn(
    "/bin/bash",
    ["bash", "-c", "echo 'Output'; echo 'Error' &gt;&amp;2"],
    os.environ,
    file_actions=file_actions,
    spawn_attrs=spawn_attrs
)

os.waitpid(pid, 0)
print("Both output and error written to out.log")

The bash command's output and error streams are redirected to out.log. The
process runs in its own process group.

This shows how to combine multiple features of posix_spawn for advanced
process control.

## Error Handling

Proper error handling is crucial when spawning processes. This example shows
how to handle various spawn failures.

error_handling.py
  

import os
import errno

try:
    # Attempt to spawn non-existent program
    pid = os.posix_spawn(
        "/nonexistent/program",
        ["program"],
        os.environ
    )
except OSError as e:
    if e.errno == errno.ENOENT:
        print("Program not found")
    elif e.errno == errno.EACCES:
        print("Permission denied")
    else:
        print(f"Spawn failed: {e}")

try:
    # Invalid file action
    file_actions = os.posix_spawn_file_actions()
    file_actions.addopen(1, "/root/protected", os.O_WRONLY, 0o644)
    pid = os.posix_spawn(
        "/bin/true",
        ["true"],
        os.environ,
        file_actions=file_actions
    )
except PermissionError:
    print("Cannot open protected file")

The first attempt fails because the program doesn't exist. The second fails
due to permission issues with file actions.

Always handle potential errors when spawning processes, especially with
file operations or privileged paths.

## Signal Handling

Spawn attributes can control signal handling in the child process. This example
resets signal handlers to defaults.

signal_handling.py
  

import os
import signal

# Prepare spawn attributes for signal handling
spawn_attrs = os.posix_spawnattr()
spawn_attrs.setsigdefault({signal.SIGINT: signal.SIG_DFL})
spawn_attrs.setflags(os.POSIX_SPAWN_SETSIGDEF)

# Spawn process that ignores Ctrl-C
pid = os.posix_spawn(
    "/bin/bash",
    ["bash", "-c", "echo 'Running...'; sleep 10; echo 'Done'"],
    os.environ,
    spawn_attrs=spawn_attrs
)

print(f"Process {pid} running - Ctrl-C will terminate it")
os.waitpid(pid, 0)

The child process resets SIGINT to default behavior, making it interruptible
with Ctrl-C. Without this, it might inherit parent's signal handlers.

Signal handling attributes are particularly important for long-running or
interactive child processes.

## Security Considerations

- **Path security:** Validate executable paths to prevent command injection

- **Environment sanitization:** Carefully control environment variables

- **File descriptor handling:** Close unnecessary FDs in the child

- **Privilege separation:** Consider dropping privileges in child

- **Error handling:** Handle all possible spawn failures

## Best Practices

- **Use absolute paths:** For both executable and file actions

- **Clean environments:** Pass only necessary environment variables

- **Resource limits:** Set appropriate limits via spawn attributes

- **Signal management:** Explicitly set signal handling

- **Error checking:** Validate all inputs before spawning
