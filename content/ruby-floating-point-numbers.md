# Ruby Floating-Point Numbers

last modified April 1, 2025

Ruby uses a 64-bit floating-point type based on IEEE 754 via the Float class.
This guide explores its properties, precision challenges, and best practices for
numerical operations in Ruby.

## Ruby Float Overview

This section covers Ruby's Float class, its primary type for
decimal numbers. It's a 64-bit IEEE 754 double-precision float, consistent
across platforms. Knowing its range and precision helps avoid common errors in
Ruby code. The example below shows basic usage and key constants in action.
Understanding Float is crucial for effective Ruby programming.

float_overview.rb
# Float declarations
single_float = 1.2345678901234567
small_float = 5.0e-324
large_float = 1.7976931348623157e308

puts "Float: #{single_float}"
puts "Smallest positive: #{small_float}"
puts "Largest: #{large_float}"

puts "\nFloat::MIN: #{Float::MIN}"
puts "Float::MAX: #{Float::MAX}"
puts "Size in bytes: #{8}" # Always 64-bit

# Additional example: Scientific notation
sci_float = 1.23e-10
puts "\nScientific notation: #{sci_float}"

Ruby's Float class implements 64-bit IEEE 754 double-precision floating-point
numbers, offering 15-17 significant digits consistently across systems. Its
range spans ±5.0×10⁻³²⁴ (Float::MIN) to ±1.7976931348623157×10³⁰⁸
(Float::MAX), stored in 8 bytes with no platform variation. 

Unlike some languages, Ruby lacks a built-in decimal type, relying on
Float for all floating-point needs, which simplifies usage but
introduces precision quirks. For instance, small numbers like 5.0e-324 or large
ones like 1.23e-10 work seamlessly with scientific notation support. Use
Float for general math, but be aware of binary precision
limitations in calculations.

## Precision and Rounding

Ruby's Float type faces precision issues due to its binary IEEE 754
basis. This section demonstrates how decimal fractions lead to errors and how to
handle them. Examples use Ruby's rounding methods to manage precision
effectively. These skills are key to ensuring accurate numeric results in Ruby.
Mastering them prevents subtle computational mistakes.

precision_examples.rb
# Precision demonstration
a = 0.1
b = 0.2
sum = a + b

puts "0.1 + 0.2 = #{sum}"
puts "0.1 + 0.2 == 0.3? #{sum == 0.3}"
puts "Full precision: #{format('%.17f', sum)}"

value = 2.34567
puts "\nRounding examples:"
puts "round(#{value}): #{value.round}"
puts "floor(#{value}): #{value.floor}"
puts "ceil(#{value}): #{value.ceil}"
puts "round to 2 decimals: #{value.round(2)}"

# Additional example: Pi rounding
pi = 3.14159
puts "\nPi to 3 digits: #{pi.round(3)}"

Ruby's Float, being binary-based, can't exactly represent decimals
like 0.1 or 0.2, so 0.1 + 0.2 yields 0.30000000000000004, visible with
format('%.17f'). These tiny errors can accumulate in repeated operations,
necessitating careful precision control in Ruby programs. 

Methods like round (nearest integer or specified decimals),
floor (down), and ceil (up) adjust values cleanly, all
returning floats or integers as needed. For example, 2.34567.round(2) gives
2.35, perfect for controlled output, while format helps reveal full
precision when debugging. Ruby's straightforward syntax makes these tools
intuitive, but awareness of their limits is essential.

## Comparing Floating-Point Values

Comparing floats in Ruby requires care due to precision-related inaccuracies.
Direct equality often fails, so this section offers a reliable comparison
approach. It also handles special values like infinity and NaN in
Ruby's context. The example provides practical solutions for robust comparisons.
This knowledge ensures dependable logic in Ruby applications.

float_comparison.rb
def nearly_equal(a, b, epsilon = 1e-10)
  abs_a = a.abs
  abs_b = b.abs
  diff = (a - b).abs

  return true if a == b
  return diff &lt; (epsilon * Float::EPSILON) if a.zero? || b.zero? || diff &lt; Float::EPSILON
  diff / (abs_a + abs_b) &lt; epsilon
end

x = 0.1 + 0.2
y = 0.3

puts "Direct equality: #{x == y}"
puts "NearlyEqual: #{nearly_equal(x, y)}"
puts "Difference: #{x - y}"

nan = Float::NAN
inf = Float::INFINITY

puts "\nNAN == NAN: #{nan == nan}"
puts "nan.nan?: #{nan.nan?}"
puts "INF == INF: #{inf == inf}"

# Additional example: Small number comparison
small = 1e-15
puts "\nNearlyEqual(#{small}, 0): #{nearly_equal(small, 0)}"

In Ruby, == fails for float comparisons like 0.1 + 0.2 == 0.3 due
to binary precision errors, differing by a tiny amount like 5.5e-17. The
nearly_equal method uses an epsilon (e.g., 1e-10) and
Float::EPSILON to check if floats are close enough, handling
near-zero cases reliably. 

Special values like Float::NAN (not equal to itself, checked with
nan?) and Float::INFINITY (equal to itself) need
specific methods for safe handling. For small values like 1e-15 versus 0,
nearly_equal works where == doesn't, offering a practical solution.
This approach leverages Ruby's object-oriented Float class for consistent
comparison logic.

## Floating-Point for Financial Calculations

Ruby's Float type isn't ideal for financial tasks needing exact
decimal precision. This section contrasts float limitations with an
integer-based workaround. Examples show interest calculations and monetary
rounding in Ruby accurately. These methods ensure precision for financial apps
in Ruby projects. For advanced needs, Ruby's BigDecimal is recommended instead.

financial_examples.rb
principal = 1000.00
interest_rate = 0.05 # 5%
years = 10

# Using floating-point
future_value_float = principal * (1 + interest_rate)**years
puts "Future value (floating-point): $#{future_value_float.round(2)}"

# Workaround with integer cents
principal_cents = 100_000 # $1000.00 in cents
future_value_cents = (principal_cents * (1 + interest_rate)**years).round
future_value = future_value_cents / 100.0
puts "Accurate future value: $#{format('%.2f', future_value)}"

payment = 123.456789
puts "\nPayment to cents: #{payment.round(2)}"
puts "Payment rounded up: #{(payment * 100).ceil / 100.0}"
puts "Payment rounded down: #{(payment * 100).floor / 100.0}"

# Additional example: Tax calculation
price = 19.99
tax_rate = 0.08
tax = (price * tax_rate).round(2)
puts "\nTax on $#{price}: $#{tax}"

Ruby's Float introduces minor errors in financial math, like
compound interest on $1000 at 5% over 10 years, due to binary representation
limitations. Using cents as integers (e.g., 100_000 for $1000) and converting
back after calculation ensures an exact $1628.89, bypassing float issues. 

Rounding with round(2), ceil, or floor on
cents (e.g., 12345 cents to $123.45) guarantees monetary precision, critical for
financial accuracy. A tax on $19.99 at 8% becomes precisely $1.60 with
round(2), matching real-world needs without drift. For serious
financial work, require 'bigdecimal' and use BigDecimal for
arbitrary-precision decimal math.

## Best Practices

Use Float for general math in Ruby, but switch to cents or
BigDecimal for financial precision. Avoid == for float
comparisons, opting for nearly_equal with epsilon instead. Apply
round, ceil, or floor explicitly, and use
format for clean monetary display. Check Float::NAN with
nan? and Float::INFINITY with finite? to
manage edge cases safely. These habits ensure your Ruby numeric code is both
accurate and reliable.
