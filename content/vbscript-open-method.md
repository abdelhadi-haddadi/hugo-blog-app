# VBScript Open Method

last modified April 9, 2025

The Open method in VBScript is part of the
FileSystemObject. It creates or opens a file and returns a
TextStream object for reading or writing. This method is essential
for file operations in VBScript. It provides various modes for different file
handling needs.

Open allows specifying file access modes (read, write, append) and
format (ASCII or Unicode). It handles file creation and access in a single
operation. This tutorial covers Open with practical examples to
demonstrate its usage.

## Open Method Overview

The Open method takes three parameters: file path, I/O mode, and
create flag. It returns a TextStream object for file operations.
The method is available through the FileSystemObject in VBScript.

Key parameters include mode (ForReading, ForWriting, ForAppending) and format
(TristateTrue, TristateFalse, TristateUseDefault). The method can create new
files or open existing ones. Understanding these options enables flexible file
handling in scripts.

## Opening a File for Reading

This example demonstrates opening an existing file for reading. It shows the
basic syntax for file access. The script reads the first line of the file and
displays it. This is the simplest use of the Open method.

basic_read.vbs
  

Set fso = CreateObject("Scripting.FileSystemObject")
Set file = fso.OpenTextFile("C:\data\example.txt", 1, False)
firstLine = file.ReadLine
WScript.Echo firstLine
file.Close

Set file = Nothing
Set fso = Nothing

The script creates a FileSystemObject and opens "example.txt" for
reading (mode 1). It reads the first line using ReadLine and
displays it. Always close files after use to free resources. The third parameter
(False) specifies not to create the file if it doesn't exist.

## Creating and Writing to a New File

This example shows how to create a new file and write content to it. The
Open method creates the file if it doesn't exist. Writing mode
overwrites existing files by default. This demonstrates basic file creation.

create_write.vbs
  

Set fso = CreateObject("Scripting.FileSystemObject")
Set file = fso.OpenTextFile("C:\data\newfile.txt", 2, True)
file.WriteLine "This is the first line"
file.WriteLine "This is the second line"
file.Close

Set file = Nothing
Set fso = Nothing

The script opens "newfile.txt" in write mode (2). The third parameter (True)
creates the file if it doesn't exist. Two lines are written using
WriteLine. The file is automatically created in the specified
location. Always close files after writing to ensure data is saved.

## Appending to an Existing File

This example demonstrates appending content to an existing file. Append mode
preserves existing content while adding new data. The file pointer starts at the
end of the file. This is useful for log files and data collection.

append_file.vbs
  

Set fso = CreateObject("Scripting.FileSystemObject")
Set file = fso.OpenTextFile("C:\data\log.txt", 8, True)
file.WriteLine "New log entry: " &amp; Now()
file.Close

Set file = Nothing
Set fso = Nothing

The script opens "log.txt" in append mode (8). A new line with the current
timestamp is added to the end. The third parameter (True) creates the file if
missing. Append operations don't affect existing content. This pattern is common
for logging operations.

## Reading Entire File Contents

This example shows how to read an entire file at once. The
ReadAll method loads all content into memory. This is useful for
small files where memory isn't a concern. The script displays the complete file
contents.

read_all.vbs
  

Set fso = CreateObject("Scripting.FileSystemObject")
Set file = fso.OpenTextFile("C:\data\document.txt", 1, False)
content = file.ReadAll
WScript.Echo content
file.Close

Set file = Nothing
Set fso = Nothing

The script opens "document.txt" in read mode (1). ReadAll reads the
entire content into a string variable. This approach is simple but uses memory
proportional to file size. For large files, consider line-by-line reading. The
third parameter (False) prevents file creation if missing.

## Working with Unicode Files

This example demonstrates opening a Unicode-encoded file. The
Open method supports different encoding formats. Unicode files
require special handling for proper reading and writing. This shows how to
specify the encoding type.

unicode_file.vbs
  

Set fso = CreateObject("Scripting.FileSystemObject")
Set file = fso.OpenTextFile("C:\data\unicode.txt", 1, False, -1)
content = file.ReadAll
WScript.Echo content
file.Close

Set file = Nothing
Set fso = Nothing

The script opens "unicode.txt" with Unicode encoding (-1). The fourth parameter
specifies TristateTrue for Unicode. This ensures proper handling of Unicode
characters. The same parameter can specify ASCII (TristateFalse) or system
default (TristateUseDefault). Always match the encoding to the file's actual
format.

In this article, we have explored the Open method in VBScript,
covering its usage and practical applications. From basic reading to advanced
Unicode handling, these examples demonstrate reliable file operations. With this
knowledge, you can enhance your scripts with robust file management
capabilities.
