# Entry Criteria

last modified April 4, 2025

## Definition of Entry Criteria

Entry criteria in software testing refers to the predefined conditions that must
be met before a specific testing phase can begin. These requirements serve as
quality gates, ensuring that the system is ready for testing and that resources
won't be wasted on premature or unstable builds. Entry criteria typically
include documentation completeness, environment readiness, and code stability
metrics. They act as checkpoints that prevent testing teams from working on
defective or incomplete deliverables. By establishing clear entry criteria,
organizations maintain testing efficiency and reduce unnecessary rework.

The concept originates from formal testing methodologies but has been adapted
across various development approaches. In waterfall models, entry criteria are
strictly defined between phases, while Agile methods incorporate them at sprint
boundaries or feature handoffs. Regardless of methodology, entry criteria
provide objective measures to assess readiness rather than relying on subjective
judgments. This standardization helps align expectations between developers,
testers, and stakeholders throughout the project lifecycle.

## Broader Context of Entry Criteria

Entry criteria form part of the larger test management framework, working in
tandem with exit criteria and test completion metrics. They create a structured
approach to quality assurance by defining what "ready" means for each testing
phase. In regulated industries like healthcare or finance, entry criteria often
include compliance documentation and audit trails. For DevOps teams, they might
focus on build stability metrics and automated test pass rates in CI/CD
pipelines. This flexibility makes entry criteria valuable across different
project types and organizational maturity levels.

Beyond technical requirements, entry criteria facilitate better project
governance and risk management. They help prevent the common pitfall of
"testing-in quality" by ensuring testable deliverables from the outset. When
integrated with project management tools, entry criteria provide measurable
milestones for tracking progress. They also serve as communication tools,
clarifying handoff expectations between teams and reducing friction in
cross-functional collaborations. Ultimately, well-defined entry criteria
contribute to predictable release cycles and higher-quality software outputs.

## Characteristics of Entry Criteria

**Objective and measurable** - Defined using quantifiable
metrics rather than subjective assessments for clarity.
**Phase-specific** - Tailored to each testing level (unit,
integration, system, etc.) with appropriate requirements.
**Enforceable** - Backed by organizational processes that
prevent testing from proceeding until met.
**Documented** - Clearly written in test plans or quality
assurance guidelines for reference.
**Balanced** - Rigorous enough to ensure quality but flexible
enough to avoid unnecessary bottlenecks.
**Traceable** - Linked to specific deliverables or artifacts
that demonstrate compliance.

## Types of Entry Criteria

Entry criteria can be categorized based on their focus area within the software
development and testing process. Different testing phases and project types
require distinct sets of prerequisites to ensure effective validation. These
categories help teams address specific quality concerns at appropriate stages,
from initial development through final acceptance. Understanding these types
allows for more precise planning and better risk mitigation throughout the
project lifecycle.

The classification also reflects varying organizational priorities, with some
teams emphasizing documentation while others focus on automation readiness.
Certain types may overlap or combine in practice, but distinguishing them
conceptually helps create comprehensive quality gates. Below we outline the
primary types of entry criteria with their typical applications and benefits in
software projects.

Type
Description

Documentation Criteria
Requires completion of testable requirements, design documents, and user
stories before testing begins. Ensures testers have adequate specifications.

Technical Criteria
Focuses on code completeness, build stability, and environment readiness.
Includes metrics like compilation success rates or deployment verification.

Process Criteria
Mandates completion of prerequisite phases, such as unit testing passing
before integration testing begins. Maintains testing sequence integrity.

Resource Criteria
Verifies availability of necessary testing tools, environments, and personnel
before committing to test execution.

Compliance Criteria
Specific to regulated industries, requiring audit trails, security
certifications, or regulatory approvals before testing.

## Benefits of Entry Criteria

Implementing well-defined entry criteria offers numerous advantages throughout
the software development lifecycle. It prevents premature testing efforts on
unstable or incomplete builds, saving time and resources that would otherwise be
wasted. By establishing clear readiness standards, it reduces ambiguity between
development and QA teams regarding when deliverables are truly test-ready. This
clarity minimizes friction during handoffs and sets realistic expectations for
all stakeholders involved in the process.

Entry criteria also contribute to higher-quality outcomes by ensuring testers
receive properly prepared artifacts. They help identify gaps in requirements or
design early, when they're less costly to address. Additionally, these criteria
provide measurable checkpoints for project tracking and risk assessment. Teams
can monitor compliance with entry criteria to predict potential delays or
quality issues before they escalate. Ultimately, they foster a more disciplined
approach to quality assurance that pays dividends in reduced defect rates and
more predictable releases.

## Implementation Best Practices

- **Align with project methodology** - Adapt criteria rigor to match Agile, Waterfall, or hybrid approaches appropriately.

- **Involve all stakeholders** - Collaborate with developers, testers, and business teams to define realistic criteria.

- **Automate verification where possible** - Use CI/CD tools to automatically check technical criteria like build status.

- **Review and refine regularly** - Update criteria based on retrospective feedback and changing project needs.

- **Document exceptions** - Create a formal process for handling justified deviations from standard criteria.

- **Balance thoroughness with practicality** - Avoid overly strict criteria that might create unnecessary bottlenecks.
