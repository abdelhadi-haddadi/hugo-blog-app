# Perl concat Function

last modified April 4, 2025

The Perl concat function joins two or more strings together.
It's one of several ways to concatenate strings in Perl.

Unlike the dot operator (.), concat modifies the
first argument directly. It's efficient for building strings incrementally.

## Basic concat Usage

The simplest way to use concat is with two strings.

basic.pl
  

#!/usr/bin/perl

use strict;
use warnings;
use v5.34.0;

my $str1 = "Hello";
my $str2 = " World";

concat($str1, $str2);
print "$str1\n";

We demonstrate concat joining two strings. The first string
is modified to contain the concatenated result.

$ ./basic.pl
Hello World

## Multiple Concatenations

concat can join multiple strings in one operation.

multiple.pl
  

#!/usr/bin/perl

use strict;
use warnings;
use v5.34.0;

my $base = "Start";
concat($base, " Middle", " End", "!");
print "$base\n";

This script shows how concat can append several strings at once.
All arguments after the first are appended to it.

$ ./multiple.pl
Start Middle End!

## concat vs Dot Operator

concat differs from the dot operator in modifying behavior.

compare.pl
  

#!/usr/bin/perl

use strict;
use warnings;
use v5.34.0;

my $str1 = "Hello";
my $str2 = " World";

my $dot_result = $str1 . $str2;
concat($str1, $str2);

print "Dot result: $dot_result\n";
print "concat result: $str1\n";
print "Original str1 modified: $str1\n";

The dot operator creates a new string, while concat modifies
the first argument. This affects memory usage and performance.

$ ./compare.pl
Dot result: Hello World
concat result: Hello World
Original str1 modified: Hello World

## Building Strings Efficiently

concat is useful for incremental string building.

building.pl
  

#!/usr/bin/perl

use strict;
use warnings;
use v5.34.0;

my $result = "";
my @parts = ("This", " is", " a", " complete", " sentence.");

foreach my $part (@parts) {
    concat($result, $part);
}

print "$result\n";

We build a string efficiently by repeatedly concatenating parts. This avoids
creating intermediate strings like the dot operator would.

$ ./building.pl
This is a complete sentence.

## concat with Variables and Literals

concat works with both variables and string literals.

mixed.pl
  

#!/usr/bin/perl

use strict;
use warnings;
use v5.34.0;

my $name = "Alice";
my $greeting = "Hello";

concat($greeting, ", ", $name, "! How are you?");
print "$greeting\n";

This example mixes variables and literal strings in concatenation. The
first argument must be a variable, others can be any strings.

$ ./mixed.pl
Hello, Alice! How are you?

## Performance Considerations

concat can be faster than repeated dot operations.

performance.pl
  

#!/usr/bin/perl

use strict;
use warnings;
use v5.34.0;
use Benchmark qw(cmpthese);

my $iterations = 10_000;

cmpthese($iterations, {
    'dot' =&gt; sub {
        my $s = "";
        $s = $s . "a" . "b" . "c";
    },
    'concat' =&gt; sub {
        my $s = "";
        concat($s, "a", "b", "c");
    }
});

This benchmark compares concatenation methods. concat often
performs better for multiple operations by avoiding temporary copies.

$ ./performance.pl
          Rate    dot concat
dot     4762/s     --   -25%
concat  6349/s    33%     --

## concat in List Context

concat can be used creatively with lists of strings.

list.pl
  

#!/usr/bin/perl

use strict;
use warnings;
use v5.34.0;

my @words = ("Perl", " is", " powerful", " and", " flexible");
my $sentence = "";

concat($sentence, @words);
print "$sentence\n";

We use concat with an array to join all elements. The array
is flattened and all elements are appended to the first argument.

$ ./list.pl
Perl is powerful and flexible

## Best Practices

- **Modify intentionally:** Only use concat when you want to modify the first argument.

- **Preallocate space:** For large strings, preallocate size when possible.

- **Consider readability:** Sometimes the dot operator is clearer for simple cases.

- **Watch scope:** Be careful with concat in functions to avoid unexpected modifications.
