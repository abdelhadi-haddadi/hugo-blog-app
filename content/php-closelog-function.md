# PHP closelog Function

last modified April 4, 2025

The PHP closelog function closes the connection to the system
logger. It's used after logging messages with openlog and
syslog.

## Basic Definition

closelog terminates the connection to the system logger that
was established with openlog. It's part of PHP's syslog
functions.

Syntax: closelog(): bool. Returns true on success, false on
failure. No parameters are needed as it closes the current connection.

## Basic Logging Example

This example shows a complete logging cycle with openlog, syslog, and closelog.

basic_logging.php
  

&lt;?php

declare(strict_types=1);

// Open connection to system logger
openlog("MyPHPApp", LOG_PID | LOG_PERROR, LOG_LOCAL0);

// Send a log message
syslog(LOG_WARNING, "This is a warning message");

// Close the logger connection
closelog();

echo "Log message sent and connection closed";

This demonstrates proper resource management by closing the logger after use.
The closelog frees system resources used for logging.

## Error Handling with closelog

This example shows how to handle errors when closing the system logger.

error_handling.php
  

&lt;?php

declare(strict_types=1);

openlog("ErrorHandlingApp", LOG_PID, LOG_USER);

syslog(LOG_ERR, "An error occurred in the application");

if (!closelog()) {
    echo "Failed to close system logger connection";
} else {
    echo "Logger connection closed successfully";
}

Checking the return value of closelog helps identify issues.
While failures are rare, proper error handling makes applications more robust.

## Logging in a Function

This example demonstrates proper logger cleanup in a function context.

function_logging.php
  

&lt;?php

declare(strict_types=1);

function logEvent(string $message, int $priority = LOG_INFO): void {
    openlog("FunctionLogger", LOG_PID, LOG_LOCAL1);
    syslog($priority, $message);
    closelog();
}

logEvent("User logged in successfully");
logEvent("Failed login attempt", LOG_WARNING);

Each function call properly manages its logging resources by calling
closelog. This prevents resource leaks in long-running scripts.

## Conditional Logging

This example shows conditional logging with proper cleanup in all code paths.

conditional_logging.php
  

&lt;?php

declare(strict_types=1);

function processData($data) {
    openlog("DataProcessor", LOG_PID, LOG_USER);
    
    try {
        if (empty($data)) {
            syslog(LOG_WARNING, "Empty data received");
            return false;
        }
        
        syslog(LOG_INFO, "Processing data: " . substr($data, 0, 20));
        // Process data here
        return true;
    } finally {
        closelog();
    }
}

processData("Sample data to process");

The finally block ensures closelog is called
regardless of how the function exits. This is a robust logging pattern.

## Logging in a Class

This example demonstrates proper logger management in an object-oriented context.

class_logging.php
  

&lt;?php

declare(strict_types=1);

class ApplicationLogger {
    public function logMessage(string $message, int $priority): void {
        openlog("AppLoggerClass", LOG_PID, LOG_LOCAL0);
        syslog($priority, $message);
        closelog();
    }
    
    public function __destruct() {
        // Ensure logger is closed if still open
        closelog();
    }
}

$logger = new ApplicationLogger();
$logger-&gt;logMessage("Application started", LOG_INFO);

The class properly closes the logger after each message and includes a destructor
as a safety net. This prevents resource leaks in object-oriented applications.

## Best Practices

- **Always close:** Always call closelog after finishing logging

- **Error handling:** Check return values in critical applications

- **Resource management:** Use try-finally for reliable cleanup

- **Performance:** Reuse connections for multiple log messages
