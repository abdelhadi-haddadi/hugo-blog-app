## PostgreSQL &amp; PHP

*PostgreSQL* is a powerful, open source object-relational 
database system. It is a multi-user database management system. 
It runs on multiple platforms including Linux, FreeBSD, Solaris, 
Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X. PostgreSQL is developed by the 
PostgreSQL Global Development Group.

*PHP* is a scripting language designed for web development. 
It is used to produce dynamic web pages. Currently, PHP is one of 
the most widely used programming languages. Much of its syntax is 
borrowed from C, Java and Perl with a couple of unique PHP-specific 
features. PHP can be embedded into HTML code and it generally 
runs on a web server. PHP supports both object oriented and procedural 
programming styles.
