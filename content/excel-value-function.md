# Excel VALUE Function

last modified April 4, 2025

The VALUE function converts text that represents a number into a 
numeric value. This tutorial provides a comprehensive guide to using the 
VALUE function with detailed examples. You'll learn basic syntax, 
practical applications, and common scenarios where VALUE is essential for data 
conversion in Excel.

## VALUE Function Basics

The VALUE function converts text strings that represent numbers 
into actual numeric values. This is particularly useful when importing data 
from other systems that may store numbers as text.

  
    Component
    Description
  
  
    Function Name
    VALUE
  
  
    Syntax
    =VALUE(text)
  
  
    Arguments
    text - The text to convert to a number
  
  
    Return Value
    Numeric value of the text string
  

This table breaks down the essential components of the VALUE
function. It shows the function name, basic syntax format, argument 
requirements, and return value characteristics.

## Basic VALUE Example

This example demonstrates the simplest use of the VALUE function with a text 
string that represents a number.

Basic VALUE formula
  

=VALUE("123.45")

This formula converts the text string "123.45" into the numeric value 123.45. 
The result can then be used in mathematical calculations. Note the quotes 
around the text value.

## VALUE with Cell References

A more practical use of VALUE involves converting text values 
stored in cells. Here's an example with cell references.

  
    A
    B
  
  
    "100"
    
  
  
    "25.75"
    
  
  
    "$1,000"
    
  
  
    
    =VALUE(A1)
  

The table shows a simple spreadsheet with text values in column A and a 
VALUE formula in cell B4 that converts the text in A1 to a number.

VALUE with cell reference
  

=VALUE(A1)

This formula converts the text "100" in cell A1 to the numeric value 100. The 
result can then be used in calculations. Note that VALUE cannot convert text 
with currency symbols or commas by default.

## VALUE with Currency Symbols

This example shows how to handle text strings containing currency symbols and 
other non-numeric characters.

  
    A
    B
  
  
    "$125.99"
    
  
  
    "€250"
    
  
  
    "¥1,000"
    
  
  
    
    =VALUE(SUBSTITUTE(SUBSTITUTE(A1,"$",""),",",""))
  

The table demonstrates how to combine VALUE with other functions to handle 
currency symbols and thousands separators. The nested SUBSTITUTE functions 
remove these characters before conversion.

VALUE with currency cleaning
  

=VALUE(SUBSTITUTE(SUBSTITUTE(A1,"$",""),",",""))

This formula first removes the dollar sign and then commas before converting 
the text to a number. The result for "$1,000" would be 1000. This technique 
can be adapted for different currency symbols.

## VALUE with Dates

The VALUE function can convert text representations of dates into Excel date 
serial numbers. This example demonstrates this capability.

  
    A
    B
  
  
    "01/15/2023"
    
  
  
    "15-Jan-2023"
    
  
  
    "2023-01-15"
    
  
  
    
    =VALUE(A1)
  

The table shows different text representations of dates in column A. The VALUE 
function in B4 converts the text date in A1 to Excel's date serial number.

VALUE with date text
  

=VALUE("01/15/2023")

This formula converts the text date "01/15/2023" to Excel's date serial number 
(44927 for this date). You can then format the result as a date. Note that 
date format recognition depends on your system's regional settings.

## VALUE with Time Text

Similar to dates, VALUE can convert text representations of times into Excel 
time values. This example shows this application.

  
    A
    B
  
  
    "12:30 PM"
    
  
  
    "18:45"
    
  
  
    "9:15:30 AM"
    
  
  
    
    =VALUE(A1)
  

The table demonstrates different text time formats in column A. The VALUE 
function in B4 converts the text time in A1 to Excel's time serial number.

VALUE with time text
  

=VALUE("12:30 PM")

This formula converts the text time "12:30 PM" to Excel's time value (0.520833, 
representing 12:30 PM as a fraction of a 24-hour day). The result can be 
formatted as time for display.

## VALUE with Error Handling

When VALUE encounters text it cannot convert to a number, it returns a #VALUE! 
error. This example shows how to handle such cases.

  
    A
    B
  
  
    "123"
    
  
  
    "ABC"
    
  
  
    "45.67"
    
  
  
    
    =IFERROR(VALUE(A2),"Invalid number")
  

The table shows how to combine VALUE with IFERROR to handle conversion errors 
gracefully. The formula in B4 attempts to convert A2 but returns a custom 
message if conversion fails.

VALUE with error handling
  

=IFERROR(VALUE(A2),"Invalid number")

This formula attempts to convert the text in A2 to a number. If successful, it 
returns the number. If not, it returns "Invalid number" instead of an error. 
This makes your spreadsheets more user-friendly.

The VALUE function is essential for converting text to numbers in 
Excel. From simple number strings to complex date and time formats, VALUE 
helps prepare data for calculations. Remember that VALUE cannot directly 
handle currency symbols or thousands separators without preprocessing. 
Mastering VALUE and its combinations with other functions will significantly 
improve your data cleaning capabilities.
