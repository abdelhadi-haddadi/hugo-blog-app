Amazon Q Businesslets you create a chat app for your organization using your company data and AI knowledge, or just your company data. Workflow is different for admin and user, here in this article we have covered both of them.

As an admin user, when configuring an Amazon Q Business application, you need to decide whether to useIAM Identity CenterorAWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)for managing access to your application. This choice affects the application creation process.

The following section outlines the admin workflow for creating applications with IAM Identity Center and Identity Federation through IAM.

To manage end user access to Amazon Q Business applications using AWS IAM Identity Center, you need to create an IAM Identity Center instance and configure it for your Amazon Q Business application. This allows you to manage access based on your organization's identity provider.

As an admin, use IAM Identity Center to manage users and create an Amazon Q Business application environment by completing the following steps.

Amazon Q Business creates a web experience for you when you create an application environment using the console. If you use the API, you need to create the web experience yourself.

Amazon Q Business uses Identity Federation through IAM to manage end user access to applications. This means your application gets user identities directly from your identity provider.
