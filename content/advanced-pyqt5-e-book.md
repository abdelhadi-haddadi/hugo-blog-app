# Advanced PyQt5 e-book

![pixel.gif](images/pixel.gif)

The e-book has 252 pages. It has 101 code examples. Many of the examples are unique; reader
will not find them anywhere else. It is an ideal material for those who already
know some basics of PyQt5 library. Carefully chosen examples always focus on one important
aspect. Unless it is a more complex example. The book is written in plain English. 

The code examples were tested on Linux and Windows, Python 3.8.1 and PyQt5 5.15.0 on Windows 10 and
Python 3.9.5 and PyQt 5.15.4 on Debian Linux. After purchasing the e-book, you
will obtain a ZIP file. With the PDF file, you will also obtain all code examples.

## Price

The e-book costs 19 â‚¬.

## About this tutorial

This is Advanced PyQt5 e-book. This e-book is a tutorial 
which covers several interesting parts of the library.

This e-book covers the following:

  - Date and time

  - Graphics

  - The Graphics View Framework

  - Layout management

  - Custom widgets

  - Model &amp; View widgets

  - QtSql module

  - Networking

  - Games

The first chapter covers date and time. The examples demonstrate date
and time arithmetic, show how to work with universal and local time,
epochs, or daylight saving time.

In the Graphics chapter, we do some basic and more advanced painting.
The Graphics View framework chapter covers Graphics View framework, 
which is a high level framework to create graphics quickly and efficiently.

Layout management is considered to be one of the most difficult areas of GUI
programming. Writers usually only skim the topic, covering the very basics of
it. Based on my experience while writing a complete e-book dedicated to 
layout management, this chapter was a piece of cake. Once you know the principles
behind the process, you can utilize them in other GUI toolkits too.
In this chapter you will learn everything important about layout management. 

In the Custom widgets chapter, we will show how to create three custom widgets: a Led widget, 
a CPU widget and a Thermometer widget. 

In the Model &amp; View widgets part, we will cover important Model/View
widgets. You will learn how to work with QTableView, QTreeView
and QListView. 

In the QtSql module chapter, we will cover the basics of the QtSql which
is used for database programming.

Network programming is covered in the networking chapter. The examples show how
to download an icon from a web page, create a simple web server or determine weather conditions.

One of the best ways to learn programming is to create computer games. As a bonus,
you will have three simple 2D games: Nibbles, Sokoban, and Minesweeper.
