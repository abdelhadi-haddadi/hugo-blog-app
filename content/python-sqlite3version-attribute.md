# Python sqlite3.version Attribute

Last modified April 15, 2025

This comprehensive guide explores Python's sqlite3.version attribute,
which provides version information about the SQLite library. We'll cover its usage,
format, and practical examples.

## Basic Definitions

The sqlite3.version attribute is a string that represents the version
number of the SQLite library being used by Python's sqlite3 module.

This attribute is read-only and follows semantic versioning. It helps determine
feature availability and compatibility when working with SQLite databases.

## Basic Version Check

Here's the simplest usage of sqlite3.version to check the SQLite
library version.

basic_version.py
  

import sqlite3

# Print SQLite version
print(f"SQLite version: {sqlite3.version}")

# Example output might be: "3.35.4"

This example demonstrates how to access the version string. The output format is
typically "major.minor.patch" but may include additional information.

Knowing the SQLite version is useful for debugging and ensuring compatibility
with specific database features.

## Comparing Versions

You can compare the version string to check for specific feature support.

compare_versions.py
  

import sqlite3
from packaging import version

current_version = version.parse(sqlite3.version)
required_version = version.parse("3.35.0")

if current_version &gt;= required_version:
    print("JSON support is available")
else:
    print("JSON support requires SQLite 3.35.0 or later")

This example uses the packaging module to properly compare version
strings. It checks if JSON functions are available in the SQLite version.

Always use proper version comparison libraries as string comparison may not work
correctly for version numbers.

## Version in Database Connection

The version attribute can be used when establishing a database connection to log
or verify compatibility.

connection_version.py
  

import sqlite3

with sqlite3.connect('test.db') as conn:
    cursor = conn.cursor()
    cursor.execute("SELECT sqlite_version()")
    db_version = cursor.fetchone()[0]
    
    print(f"Library version: {sqlite3.version}")
    print(f"Database engine version: {db_version}")

This example shows both the library version and the actual database engine
version, which should typically match but might differ in some configurations.

The sqlite_version function returns the version of the SQLite
engine, while sqlite3.version shows the library version.

## Version-Dependent Features

You can use the version to enable or disable specific features in your code.

feature_check.py
  

import sqlite3
from packaging import version

def supports_window_functions():
    return version.parse(sqlite3.version) &gt;= version.parse("3.25.0")

with sqlite3.connect(':memory:') as conn:
    if supports_window_functions():
        print("Window functions are available")
        # Use window functions here
    else:
        print("Window functions require SQLite 3.25.0 or later")

This example checks for window function support, introduced in SQLite 3.25.0.
The code can then adapt its behavior based on available features.

Feature detection is more reliable than version checking when possible, but
version checks are useful for planning feature usage.

## Version in Error Handling

The version information can be included in error messages for better debugging.

error_handling.py
  

import sqlite3

try:
    with sqlite3.connect(':memory:') as conn:
        cursor = conn.cursor()
        cursor.execute("CREATE TABLE test (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY)")
        cursor.execute("INSERT INTO test VALUES (1)")
        cursor.execute("INSERT INTO test VALUES (1)")  # Duplicate key
except sqlite3.IntegrityError as e:
    print(f"Error (SQLite {sqlite3.version}): {e}")

This example includes the SQLite version in error messages, which helps when
diagnosing version-specific behavior or bugs.

Logging version information with errors is particularly valuable in distributed
applications where different nodes might have different SQLite versions.

## Version in Application Info

You can display version information as part of your application's diagnostic data.

app_info.py
  

import sqlite3
import sys

def get_system_info():
    return {
        "python_version": sys.version,
        "sqlite_version": sqlite3.version,
        "sqlite_sql_version": None
    }

with sqlite3.connect(':memory:') as conn:
    cursor = conn.cursor()
    cursor.execute("SELECT sqlite_version()")
    info = get_system_info()
    info["sqlite_sql_version"] = cursor.fetchone()[0]
    
    print("System Information:")
    for key, value in info.items():
        print(f"{key:20}: {value}")

This example collects comprehensive version information about Python and SQLite,
which is useful for support and debugging purposes.

Such information can be automatically included in bug reports or logged during
application startup for diagnostic purposes.

## Version in Requirements Check

You can verify the SQLite version meets your application's minimum requirements.

requirements_check.py
  

import sqlite3
from packaging import version
import sys

MIN_SQLITE_VERSION = "3.31.0"

def check_requirements():
    current = version.parse(sqlite3.version)
    required = version.parse(MIN_SQLITE_VERSION)
    
    if current &lt; required:
        print(f"Error: Requires SQLite {MIN_SQLITE_VERSION}+ (found {sqlite3.version})")
        sys.exit(1)
    print(f"SQLite version {sqlite3.version} meets requirements")

check_requirements()

# Rest of application...

This example demonstrates how to enforce minimum version requirements at
application startup, failing gracefully if they're not met.

Such checks are particularly important for applications that depend on specific
SQLite features introduced in certain versions.

## Best Practices

- **Use proper version comparison:** Don't compare version strings directly

- **Document version requirements:** Clearly state minimum SQLite versions

- **Include version in diagnostics:** Helps with troubleshooting

- **Consider feature detection:** More reliable than version checks

- **Handle version mismatches:** Between library and engine
