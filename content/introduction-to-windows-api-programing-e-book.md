The *Introduction* chapter introduces Windows API and the Pelles C IDE.
The *Essentials* chapter covers functions in a generic way, mentions
windows data types, handles, and macros. The *Main functions* chapter talks about
the available main functions. We mention both console and UI main functions.
The *System functions* chapter describes several system-related
functions. For instance, we show how to lock the workstation, get the
computer name, or determine the CPU speed. The *Strings* chapter
is dedicated to the all-important topic of strings in Windows API. We mention
the classic ANSI C string functions, security enhanced string functions, and
Windows API string functions.

In the *Locale* chapter we talk about functions related
to the native-language environment. In this chapter, we show how to
get locale information, format currency, numbers, or dates in the
current locale, and compare strings. In the *Date and time* chapter we
work with date and time. We determine the local and universal time, do arithmetic
operations with dates, or format date and time. In the *Files and directories*
chapter we work with files and directories. We create and remove directories,
copy and delete files, or read and write to a file. In the *Window chapter*
we describe how to create our first window in a detail.

In the *First steps in UI* chapter we create simple UI programs. For instance,
we create a centered window, register a hot key, or flash a window.
The *Menus* chapter is dedicated to menus. We create both classic menus and
popup menus. In the *Controls* chapter we describe fourteen controls,
including button, check box, trackbar, status bar, and combo box. The *List*
box chapter describes the List box control; it has six examples describing it.
In the *Graphics* chapter we perform drawing. We draw basic primitives,
shapes, text or work with regions and clipping.
