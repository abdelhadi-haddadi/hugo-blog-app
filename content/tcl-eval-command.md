# Tcl eval Command

last modified April 3, 2025

The Tcl eval command evaluates one or more Tcl scripts. It's a
powerful command that allows dynamic execution of Tcl code. The command
concatenates its arguments and evaluates the result as a Tcl script.

## Basic Definition

The eval command takes one or more arguments, joins them together
with spaces, and evaluates the result as a Tcl script. It's useful for
constructing and executing commands dynamically.

Syntax: eval arg ?arg ...?. The arguments are concatenated and
evaluated as a Tcl script. The return value is the result of the evaluation.

## Basic eval Usage

This example shows the simplest usage of eval to execute a command.

basic_eval.tcl
  

set cmd "puts"
set arg "\"Hello, Tcl!\""
eval $cmd $arg

Here we construct a command dynamically by storing the command name and its
argument in variables. The eval command then executes the complete
command.

## Evaluating Multiple Commands

eval can evaluate multiple commands at once when they're combined
into a single script.

eval_multiple.tcl
  

set script {
    set x 10
    set y 20
    expr {$x + $y}
}
set result [eval $script]
puts "The result is $result"

This example demonstrates how eval can execute a block of Tcl code
stored in a variable. The script sets two variables and returns their sum.

## Building Commands Dynamically

eval is particularly useful when you need to build commands
dynamically based on runtime conditions.

eval_dynamic.tcl
  

proc calculate {operation args} {
    set cmd "expr {[join $args $operation]}"
    eval $cmd
}

set sum [calculate + 5 10 15]
puts "Sum: $sum"

This creates a flexible calculator procedure that builds an expression based on
the provided operation. The eval command executes the dynamically
constructed expression.

## Handling Command Substitution

eval properly handles command substitution and variable expansion
when building commands.

eval_substitution.tcl
  

set name "John"
set age 30
set cmd "puts"
set args [list "Name: $name, Age: $age"]

eval $cmd $args

This example shows how eval processes variable substitution in the
arguments before executing the command. The list command helps maintain proper
argument grouping.

## Evaluating Lists as Commands

eval can evaluate a properly formatted list as a command with its
arguments.

eval_list.tcl
  

set command [list puts "Hello from a list!"]
eval $command

set math [list expr 10 + 20 * 2]
set result [eval $math]
puts "Math result: $result"

Here we construct complete commands as lists and execute them with eval.
This technique is useful for building commands programmatically while maintaining
proper argument separation.

## Safe Evaluation with try

When using eval with untrusted input, it's good practice to use
error handling.

eval_safe.tcl
  

set userInput "expr {10 / 0}" ;# Dangerous input

try {
    set result [eval $userInput]
    puts "Result: $result"
} trap {ARITH DIVZERO} {msg} {
    puts "Error: Division by zero"
} on error {msg} {
    puts "Evaluation error: $msg"
}

This demonstrates safe evaluation of potentially dangerous input. The try
command catches arithmetic errors and other evaluation problems that might occur.

## Best Practices

- **Safety:** Always validate input before evaluation.

- **Lists:** Use lists to build commands for proper quoting.

- **Error handling:** Use try/catch for robust error handling.

- **Alternatives:** Consider safer alternatives when possible.

- **Scope:** Be aware of variable scope during evaluation.
