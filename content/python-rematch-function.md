# Python re.match() Function

last modified April 20, 2025

## Introduction to re.match

The re.match function checks if a regular expression matches
at the beginning of a string. It's part of Python's re module.

Unlike re.search, which looks anywhere in the string,
re.match only checks the start. It returns a match object
if found or None otherwise.

This function is useful for validating input formats or extracting data
from structured text where patterns appear at the beginning.

## Basic Syntax

The syntax for re.match is straightforward:

re.match(pattern, string, flags=0)

The pattern is the regular expression string. The
string is the text to search. Optional flags
modify matching behavior.

## Basic Pattern Matching

Let's start with a simple example of matching a pattern at string start.

basic_match.py
  

#!/usr/bin/python

import re

text = "hello world"
result = re.match(r'hello', text)

if result:
    print("Pattern found at start")
else:
    print("Pattern not found at start")

This example checks if 'hello' appears at the beginning of the string.
The raw string (r'') prevents Python from interpreting backslashes.

result = re.match(r'hello', text)

This attempts to match the literal 'hello' at the start of the string.
If successful, it returns a match object; otherwise, it returns None.

if result:

We check if the match was successful. The match object evaluates to True
if a match was found, False otherwise.

## Matching with Groups

Parentheses create capturing groups that extract parts of the match.

groups_match.py
  

#!/usr/bin/python

import re

text = "2023-12-25 log entry"
result = re.match(r'(\d{4})-(\d{2})-(\d{2})', text)

if result:
    print(f"Full match: {result.group(0)}")
    print(f"Year: {result.group(1)}")
    print(f"Month: {result.group(2)}")
    print(f"Day: {result.group(3)}")

This extracts date components from a log entry format. Groups are accessed
using the group method with 1-based indexing.

## Using Flags

Flags modify matching behavior. Here's how to use them with re.match.

flags_match.py
  

#!/usr/bin/python

import re

text = "Python is awesome"
result = re.match(r'python', text, re.IGNORECASE)

if result:
    print("Found match (case insensitive)")
else:
    print("No match found")

The re.IGNORECASE flag makes the match case-insensitive.
Other useful flags include re.MULTILINE and re.DOTALL.

## Matching Special Patterns

re.match can validate complex patterns like email addresses.

email_match.py
  

#!/usr/bin/python

import re

email = "user@example.com"
pattern = r'^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$'

result = re.match(pattern, email)

if result:
    print("Valid email format")
else:
    print("Invalid email format")

This checks if a string starts with a valid email format. The pattern
validates the basic structure of email addresses.

## Matching vs. Searching

Demonstrating the difference between match and search.

match_vs_search.py
  

#!/usr/bin/python

import re

text = "The answer is 42"

match_result = re.match(r'\d+', text)
search_result = re.search(r'\d+', text)

print(f"match result: {'found' if match_result else 'not found'}")
print(f"search result: {'found' if search_result else 'not found'}")

re.match fails because numbers aren't at the start, while
re.search succeeds by finding them anywhere in the string.

## Named Groups

Named groups make patterns more readable and maintainable.

named_groups.py
  

#!/usr/bin/python

import re

text = "Temperature: 23.5C"
pattern = r'Temperature: (?P&lt;value&gt;\d+\.\d+)(?P&lt;unit&gt;[CF])'

result = re.match(pattern, text)

if result:
    print(f"Value: {result.group('value')}")
    print(f"Unit: {result.group('unit')}")

Named groups (?P&lt;name&gt;) allow accessing matches by name
instead of position. This improves code clarity.

## Compiled Patterns with Match

For better performance with repeated matches, use compiled patterns.

compiled_match.py
  

#!/usr/bin/python

import re

pattern = re.compile(r'^[A-Z][a-z]+$')
names = ["Alice", "bob", "Charlie", "david"]

for name in names:
    if pattern.match(name):
        print(f"{name} is properly capitalized")
    else:
        print(f"{name} is not properly capitalized")

Compiling the pattern once improves performance when matching multiple
strings. The match method works like re.match.

## Best Practices

When using re.match, follow these best practices:

- Use raw strings (r'') for patterns to avoid escaping issues

- Check if the match object is not None before using it

- Prefer named groups for complex patterns with multiple groups

- Consider re.search if you need to find patterns anywhere

- Compile patterns when using them repeatedly for better performance

## Performance Considerations

re.match is efficient for checking string prefixes. For
one-time matches, the performance difference with compiled patterns
is negligible.

Python internally caches recently used patterns, but explicit compilation
helps when the same pattern is used many times in a loop.
