# VBScript WindowsSecurity Method

last modified April 9, 2025

The WindowsSecurity method in VBScript is part of the
FileSystemObject security features. It provides access to Windows
file system security settings and permissions. This method allows scripts to
manage file and folder security programmatically. It's essential for
administrative scripts that need to control access rights.

WindowsSecurity enables checking and modifying ACLs (Access Control
Lists) through VBScript. It works with both NTFS and share permissions. This
tutorial covers WindowsSecurity with practical examples to
demonstrate its usage in real-world scenarios.

## WindowsSecurity Method Overview

The WindowsSecurity method provides access to security descriptors
for files and folders. It returns a SecurityDescriptor object that
contains security information. This object can be used to examine or modify
permissions.

Key features include reading existing permissions and setting new ones. It works
with users, groups, and their respective access rights. Understanding this
method helps create secure file management scripts. Proper permissions are
crucial for system security and data protection.

## Checking File Permissions

This example demonstrates how to check permissions for a specific file. It shows
how to retrieve the security descriptor and examine its properties. The script
displays whether the current user has read access to the file.

check_permissions.vbs
  

Set fso = CreateObject("Scripting.FileSystemObject")
Set file = fso.GetFile("C:\secure\data.txt")
Set sd = file.WindowsSecurity

WScript.Echo "Owner: " &amp; sd.Owner
WScript.Echo "Group: " &amp; sd.Group
WScript.Echo "DACL present: " &amp; sd.DACLPresent

Set sd = Nothing
Set file = Nothing
Set fso = Nothing

The script creates a FileSystemObject and gets a file object. It
then retrieves the security descriptor using WindowsSecurity. The
script displays the owner, group, and whether a DACL (Discretionary ACL) exists.
This information helps assess file security.

## Modifying File Permissions

This example shows how to modify permissions for a file. It demonstrates adding
a new access control entry to the file's DACL. The script grants read access to
a specific user.

modify_permissions.vbs
  

Set fso = CreateObject("Scripting.FileSystemObject")
Set file = fso.GetFile("C:\secure\data.txt")
Set sd = file.WindowsSecurity

' Create a new trustee object for the user
Set trustee = CreateObject("AccessControl.Trustee")
trustee.Name = "DOMAIN\username"
trustee.TrusteeType = 1 ' USER

' Create a new ACE (Access Control Entry)
Set ace = CreateObject("AccessControl.Ace")
ace.AccessMask = 1 ' FILE_READ_DATA
ace.AceType = 0 ' ACCESS_ALLOWED_ACE_TYPE
ace.Trustee = trustee

' Add the ACE to the DACL
sd.DACL.AddAce ace
sd.WriteDACL

Set ace = Nothing
Set trustee = Nothing
Set sd = Nothing
Set file = Nothing
Set fso = Nothing

The script creates a trustee object representing the user. It then creates an ACE
with read permissions. The ACE is added to the file's DACL, and
WriteDACL saves the changes. This demonstrates programmatic
permission management.

## Inheriting Parent Folder Permissions

This example shows how to configure permission inheritance from a parent folder.
It demonstrates disabling inheritance and copying existing permissions. This is
useful for creating secure subfolders with controlled access.

inheritance.vbs
  

Set fso = CreateObject("Scripting.FileSystemObject")
Set folder = fso.GetFolder("C:\secure\newfolder")
Set sd = folder.WindowsSecurity

' Disable inheritance and copy existing permissions
sd.ControlFlags = sd.ControlFlags Or 16 ' SE_DACL_PROTECTED
sd.WriteControlFlags

WScript.Echo "Inheritance disabled and permissions preserved"

Set sd = Nothing
Set folder = Nothing
Set fso = Nothing

The script gets a folder object and its security descriptor. It sets the
SE_DACL_PROTECTED flag to disable inheritance. The existing
permissions are preserved but won't update from the parent. This provides
granular control over folder security.

## Checking Effective Permissions

This example demonstrates checking effective permissions for a user. It shows how
to verify what access a specific user actually has to a file. This considers all
group memberships and permission inheritance.

effective_permissions.vbs
  

Set fso = CreateObject("Scripting.FileSystemObject")
Set file = fso.GetFile("C:\secure\data.txt")
Set sd = file.WindowsSecurity

Set trustee = CreateObject("AccessControl.Trustee")
trustee.Name = "DOMAIN\username"
trustee.TrusteeType = 1 ' USER

' Check for specific permissions
hasRead = sd.CheckAccess(trustee, 1) ' FILE_READ_DATA
hasWrite = sd.CheckAccess(trustee, 2) ' FILE_WRITE_DATA

WScript.Echo "Read access: " &amp; hasRead
WScript.Echo "Write access: " &amp; hasWrite

Set trustee = Nothing
Set sd = Nothing
Set file = Nothing
Set fso = Nothing

The script creates a trustee object for the target user. It then checks for
specific permissions using CheckAccess. The results show the user's
effective permissions, considering all security factors. This is valuable for
troubleshooting access issues.

## Setting Folder Ownership

This example demonstrates changing ownership of a folder. It shows how to
transfer ownership to another user or group. Ownership changes require
appropriate privileges to complete.

set_ownership.vbs
  

Set fso = CreateObject("Scripting.FileSystemObject")
Set folder = fso.GetFolder("C:\secure\important")
Set sd = folder.WindowsSecurity

Set newOwner = CreateObject("AccessControl.Trustee")
newOwner.Name = "DOMAIN\adminuser"
newOwner.TrusteeType = 1 ' USER

sd.Owner = newOwner
sd.WriteOwner

WScript.Echo "Ownership changed successfully"

Set newOwner = Nothing
Set sd = Nothing
Set folder = Nothing
Set fso = Nothing

The script creates a trustee object for the new owner. It assigns this trustee
to the security descriptor's Owner property. WriteOwner applies
the change. Ownership control is crucial for proper security management.
