## Tcl

Tcl is a string based scripting language. The source code is compiled 
into bytecode, which is later interpreted by the Tcl interpreter. It was 
created by John Osterhout in 1988. The language is commonly used for rapid 
prototyping, scripted applications, GUIs, and testing. The Tcl stands for 
tool command language, where the source code of a Tcl script consists of commands.
