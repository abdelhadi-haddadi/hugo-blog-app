# Groovy Functions

last modified February 25, 2025

Functions in Groovy are tidy, reusable packets of code designed to tackle
specific tasks. They streamline your programs, cut down on repetition, and
boost clarity, making your codebase a joy to navigate. This tutorial unpacks
how to craft and apply functions in Groovy with hands-on, practical examples.

## Defining a Function

Groovy functions spring to life with the def keyword, followed by
a name and optional parameters, all wrapped in curly braces. They're the
building blocks for modular, efficient code.

SimpleFunction.groovy
  

def welcomeUser(name) {
    "Welcome aboard, $name!"
}

println welcomeUser("Alice")

welcomeUser takes a name and crafts a warm greeting
using Groovy's string interpolation. Picture this in a user onboarding flow,
greeting new signups with a personal touch—simple yet effective.

## Function Parameters

Functions can juggle multiple parameters, with Groovy tossing in perks like
default values and named arguments to keep calls flexible and intuitive.

FunctionParameters.groovy
  

def greetUser(name, greeting = "Welcome") {
    "$greeting, $name!"
}

println greetUser("Alice")
println greetUser("Bob", "Hello")

greetUser defaults greeting to "Welcome" if omitted,
letting you tweak the tone on the fly. This could shine in a notification
system, adapting messages for different user actions without extra functions.

## Returning Values

Functions deliver results via return, though Groovy's laid-back
style lets the last expression double as the return value—no fuss needed.

ReturnValues.groovy
  

def calcSubtotal(items, price) {
    items * price
}

println calcSubtotal(3, 10.99)

calcSubtotal multiplies items by price, skipping an explicit
return. Think of it tallying a cart in an online store—clean,
quick, and ready to scale with more logic if needed.

## Function Overloading

Groovy skips traditional overloading, leaning on default parameters and
optional arguments instead. It's a slick way to handle varied inputs without
cloning function signatures.

FunctionOverloading.groovy
  

def logMessage(msg, level = "INFO", timestamp = false) {
    def prefix = timestamp ? "[${new Date()}] " : ""
    "$prefix[$level] $msg"
}

println logMessage("Login successful")
println logMessage("Error occurred", "ERROR")
println logMessage("Task started", "DEBUG", true)

logMessage adapts with defaults for level and
timestamp, mimicking overloading. It's a mini logger for an app,
flexing from basic to detailed logs without rewriting—pure Groovy finesse.

## Higher-Order Functions

Higher-order functions in Groovy can accept or return other functions,
unlocking dynamic, reusable logic that bends to your needs like a Swiss Army
knife.

HigherOrderFunctions.groovy
  

def processData(data, transform) {
    transform(data)
}

def toUpper = { it.toUpperCase() }
def reverse = { it.reverse() }

println processData("hello", toUpper)
println processData("world", reverse)

processData applies a transform closure to
data. Here, it uppercases or reverses text—perfect for a text
editor's formatting tools, swapping transforms without altering the core
function.

## Recursive Functions

Recursive functions call themselves to chip away at problems, breaking them
into bite-sized pieces. They're a go-to for tasks with repeating patterns.

RecursiveFunction.groovy
  

def countDown(n) {
    if (n &lt;= 0) return "Liftoff!"
    "$n... ${countDown(n - 1)}"
}

println countDown(3)

countDown recursively counts from n to zero, ending
with "Liftoff!". Imagine this in a launch timer app, ticking down with flair—a
fun twist on recursion.

## Closures as Functions

Closures in Groovy double as functions, assignable to variables or passed
around, blending the line between named functions and on-the-fly logic.

ClosuresAsFunctions.groovy
  

def notify = { user -&gt; "Notification sent to $user" }

println notify("Alice")

notify is a closure acting as a function, sending a mock notice.
This could slot into a messaging queue, delivering alerts with the same ease
as a named function but with closure flexibility.

## Function Composition

Function composition weaves multiple functions into one, chaining their
effects with Groovy's &lt;&lt; and &gt;&gt; operators
for sleek, modular workflows.

FunctionComposition.groovy
  

def trim = { it.trim() }
def cap = { it.capitalize() }
def cleanName = trim &gt;&gt; cap

println cleanName("  alice  ")

cleanName fuses trim and cap, tidying a
name in one go. Think form validation—cleaning user input step-by-step without
clunky intermediate calls.

## Function with Named Arguments

Named arguments let you call functions with parameters in any order, boosting
readability for complex inputs like configuration settings.

NamedArgsFunction.groovy
  

def configServer(host, port = 8080, ssl = false) {
    "Server at $host:$port, SSL: $ssl"
}

println configServer(host: "localhost", ssl: true)

configServer sets up a server with defaults, using named arguments
for clarity. This fits a deployment script, specifying options explicitly
without fussing over order.

## Function with List Processing

Functions can crunch lists with Groovy's collection methods, simplifying bulk
operations like summarizing data.

ListFunction.groovy
  

def summarizeSales(sales) {
    def total = sales.sum()
    "Total sales: \$$total across ${sales.size()} items"
}

println summarizeSales([10.50, 22.75, 15.00])

summarizeSales tallies a sales list with sum and
size. Ideal for a report generator, it delivers a quick snapshot
of transaction data in one tidy function.

## Memoized Function

Memoization caches function results, speeding up calls with repeated inputs—a
neat trick for performance-heavy tasks.

MemoizedFunction.groovy
  

def fib = { n -&gt;
    n &lt;= 1 ? n : fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)
}.memoize()

println fib(10)

fib computes Fibonacci numbers, memoized to avoid redundant
recursion. This could optimize a math tool, caching results for snappy
responses on repeated calculations.

## Best Practices for Using Functions

**Stay Focused:** Craft compact functions that tackle one job,
keeping them easy to test and reuse.
**Name with Purpose:** Pick clear, intent-revealing names like
calcSubtotal over vague ones like doIt.
**Embrace Defaults:** Use default parameters to streamline
calls and dodge redundant variants—less code, more power.
**Go Higher-Order:** Tap higher-order functions to weave in
flexibility, letting callers shape behavior dynamically.
