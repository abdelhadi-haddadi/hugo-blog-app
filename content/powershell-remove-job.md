# PowerShell Remove-Job

last modified February 15, 2025

In this article, we will cover the Remove-Job cmdlet in
PowerShell. This cmdlet deletes background jobs created with Start-Job.

## Job basics

A PowerShell job runs commands in the background without interacting with
the current session. Jobs are useful for long-running tasks. Each job has
a unique ID and state (Running, Completed, Failed). The Remove-Job
cmdlet cleans up finished jobs to free resources.

## Basic Remove-Job usage

The simplest way to use Remove-Job is with a job object. First
create a job with Start-Job, then remove it. This frees system resources
used by the job. Always verify job completion before removal.

job1.ps1
  

$job = Start-Job -ScriptBlock { Get-Process }
Remove-Job -Job $job

This creates a background job to list processes, then removes it. The job
object is stored in $job variable for reference. Verify job state with
Get-Job before removal.

## Remove job by ID

Jobs can be removed by their ID instead of object reference. First get the
job ID from Get-Job output. Then pass the ID to Remove-Job. This is useful
when working with multiple jobs.

job2.ps1
  

Start-Job -ScriptBlock { Start-Sleep -Seconds 10 }
$jobId = (Get-Job).Id
Remove-Job -Id $jobId

This starts a sleep job, gets its ID, then removes it. The job ID is
captured from Get-Job output. Use this method when you need to reference
jobs by ID.

## Remove multiple jobs

Multiple jobs can be removed at once by passing an array of job objects.
This is efficient for cleaning up many completed jobs. Use Get-Job to
retrieve all jobs first. Then pipe or pass them to Remove-Job.

job3.ps1
  

Start-Job -ScriptBlock { 1..3 | ForEach-Object { Start-Sleep -Seconds 1 } }
Start-Job -ScriptBlock { Get-ChildItem }
Get-Job | Remove-Job

This creates two jobs, then removes all jobs with Get-Job pipeline. The
command removes both running and completed jobs. Be cautious as this
removes all jobs without filtering.

## Remove completed jobs only

You can filter jobs by state before removal. The -State parameter filters
jobs by their execution state. This example removes only completed jobs.
Running or failed jobs are preserved.

job4.ps1
  

Start-Job -ScriptBlock { Get-Service }
Get-Job -State Completed | Remove-Job

This starts a service listing job, then removes only completed jobs. The
-State parameter ensures running jobs aren't accidentally removed. Always
check job states before bulk removal.

## Force remove running jobs

Running jobs can be forcibly removed with the -Force parameter. This stops
the job before removal. Use cautiously as it terminates active processes.
Data loss may occur with forced removal.

job5.ps1
  

$job = Start-Job -ScriptBlock { while($true) { Start-Sleep -Seconds 1 } }
Remove-Job -Job $job -Force

This creates an infinite loop job, then forces its removal. The -Force
parameter stops the running job. Only use this when necessary to avoid
unexpected termination.

## Remove jobs by name

Jobs can be named when created for easier identification. The -Name
parameter allows removing jobs by their assigned name. This helps manage
jobs in complex scripts.

job6.ps1
  

Start-Job -Name "DiskCheck" -ScriptBlock { Get-Disk }
Remove-Job -Name "DiskCheck"

This creates a named disk checking job, then removes it by name. Named
jobs are easier to manage than IDs or objects. Use descriptive names for
better job tracking.

## Remove jobs with confirmation

The -Confirm parameter adds a safety prompt before job removal. This
prevents accidental deletion of important jobs. The user must confirm
each removal action.

job7.ps1
  

Start-Job -ScriptBlock { Get-EventLog -LogName System }
Remove-Job -Id 1 -Confirm

This starts a system log job, then removes it with confirmation. The
user must type 'Y' to confirm removal. Use this for critical jobs where
accidental removal could cause issues.

## Remove all jobs silently

The -Force and -Confirm parameters can be combined for bulk operations.
This example removes all jobs without confirmation prompts. Use with
caution as it's irreversible.

job8.ps1
  

Start-Job -ScriptBlock { Get-HotFix }
Start-Job -ScriptBlock { Get-NetAdapter }
Get-Job | Remove-Job -Force -Confirm:$false

This creates two jobs, then removes all jobs silently. The -Confirm:$false
suppresses prompts while -Force stops running jobs. Reserve this for
scripts where no user interaction is desired.
