# PHP realpath_cache_size Function

last modified April 3, 2025

The PHP realpath_cache_size function manages the realpath cache
which stores resolved path information. This cache improves performance by
avoiding repeated filesystem lookups.

## Basic Definition

The realpath_cache_size function returns or sets the size of the
realpath cache. This cache stores resolved file paths to avoid repeated
filesystem operations.

Syntax: realpath_cache_size(): int. The function returns the current
size of the realpath cache in bytes. It can be configured in php.ini.

## Checking Current Cache Size

This example shows how to check the current size of the realpath cache.

check_cache_size.php
  

&lt;?php

declare(strict_types=1);

$cacheSize = realpath_cache_size();

echo "Current realpath cache size: " . $cacheSize . " bytes\n";

This outputs the current size of the realpath cache in bytes. The default is
typically 16K, but can vary based on PHP configuration.

## Monitoring Cache Usage

This example demonstrates how to monitor cache usage during script execution.

monitor_cache.php
  

&lt;?php

declare(strict_types=1);

function checkCache(): void {
    echo "Cache size: " . realpath_cache_size() . " bytes\n";
}

checkCache();

// Perform some filesystem operations
file_exists(__FILE__);
is_dir(__DIR__);

checkCache();

This shows how the cache size might increase after filesystem operations. The
cache grows as more paths are resolved and stored.

## Comparing Cache Before/After Operations

This example compares cache size before and after resolving multiple paths.

compare_cache.php
  

&lt;?php

declare(strict_types=1);

$initialSize = realpath_cache_size();
echo "Initial cache size: $initialSize bytes\n";

// Resolve multiple paths
for ($i = 0; $i &lt; 100; $i++) {
    realpath(__FILE__);
}

$finalSize = realpath_cache_size();
echo "Final cache size: $finalSize bytes\n";
echo "Cache growth: " . ($finalSize - $initialSize) . " bytes\n";

This demonstrates how resolving paths increases the cache size. The growth
depends on the number of unique paths resolved.

## Cache Size with Different Path Types

This example shows how different path types affect the cache size differently.

path_types_cache.php
  

&lt;?php

declare(strict_types=1);

$startSize = realpath_cache_size();

// Resolve different types of paths
realpath('/');
realpath('/tmp');
realpath(__FILE__);
realpath(__DIR__ . '/../');

$endSize = realpath_cache_size();

echo "Cache increased by: " . ($endSize - $startSize) . " bytes\n";

Different path types (root, temp, current file, parent directory) consume
varying amounts of cache space. Longer paths typically use more cache.

## Realpath Cache Info

This example combines realpath_cache_size with
realpath_cache_get for detailed cache information.

cache_info.php
  

&lt;?php

declare(strict_types=1);

// Ensure some paths are cached
realpath(__FILE__);
realpath(__DIR__);

$cacheSize = realpath_cache_size();
$cacheInfo = realpath_cache_get();

echo "Cache size: $cacheSize bytes\n";
echo "Cached entries: " . count($cacheInfo) . "\n";
echo "First entry key: " . array_key_first($cacheInfo) . "\n";

This shows the relationship between cache size and number of entries. Each
cached path consumes memory based on its length and associated data.

## Best Practices

- **Monitor Usage:** Check cache size in performance-critical apps.

- **Adjust Size:** Increase cache size if resolving many paths.

- **TTL Awareness:** Understand cached paths expire after realpath_cache_ttl.

- **Performance:** Larger caches improve performance but use more memory.
