# Tcl proc Command

last modified April 3, 2025

The Tcl proc command creates new procedures (functions) in Tcl. 
Procedures help organize code into reusable blocks. They can accept 
parameters and return values.

## Basic Definition

The proc command defines a procedure with a name, parameter list, 
and body. Procedures can be called like built-in Tcl commands. They help 
modularize code.

Syntax: proc name params body. The name is the procedure 
name. params is the parameter list. body contains 
the procedure's code.

## Simple Procedure

This example shows a basic procedure that takes no arguments and prints 
a message.

simple_proc.tcl
  

proc greet {} {
    puts "Hello, Tcl!"
}

greet

The greet procedure is defined with empty parameter list {}. 
When called, it executes its body and prints the greeting message. 
Procedures must be defined before use.

## Procedure with Parameters

Procedures can accept parameters which become variables in the procedure 
body.

proc_params.tcl
  

proc greet_name {name} {
    puts "Hello, $name!"
}

greet_name "Alice"
greet_name "Bob"

This procedure takes one parameter name. When called, the 
argument value is assigned to this parameter. The procedure can then 
use this value in its body.

## Returning Values

Procedures can return values using the return command. The 
return value can be captured by the caller.

proc_return.tcl
  

proc square {x} {
    return [expr {$x * $x}]
}

set result [square 5]
puts "5 squared is $result"

The square procedure calculates the square of its input. 
It returns the result which is captured in the result 
variable. Procedures return the result of their last command if no 
explicit return is given.

## Default Parameter Values

Parameters can have default values which are used when arguments are 
not provided.

proc_defaults.tcl
  

proc greet_optional {{name "Guest"}} {
    puts "Hello, $name!"
}

greet_optional
greet_optional "Charlie"

The name parameter has a default value "Guest". When called 
without arguments, the default is used. With an argument, it overrides 
the default. Default parameters must come after required ones.

## Variable Number of Arguments

Procedures can accept a variable number of arguments using the args 
special parameter.

proc_variable_args.tcl
  

proc sum_numbers {args} {
    set total 0
    foreach num $args {
        set total [expr {$total + $num}]
    }
    return $total
}

puts "Sum: [sum_numbers 1 2 3 4 5]"

The sum_numbers procedure accepts any number of arguments. 
These are collected in the args list. The procedure then 
iterates through them to calculate the sum. args must be 
the last parameter.

## Recursive Procedures

Procedures can call themselves recursively to solve problems that can 
be broken down into smaller subproblems.

proc_recursive.tcl
  

proc factorial {n} {
    if {$n &lt;= 1} {
        return 1
    } else {
        return [expr {$n * [factorial [expr {$n - 1}]]}]
    }
}

puts "5! = [factorial 5]"

This recursive procedure calculates factorials. It calls itself with 
a smaller value until reaching the base case (n â‰¤ 1). Recursion requires 
proper termination conditions to avoid infinite loops.

## Best Practices

- **Naming:** Use descriptive procedure names that indicate purpose.

- **Size:** Keep procedures small and focused on single tasks.

- **Documentation:** Add comments explaining complex procedures.

- **Parameters:** Limit the number of parameters for clarity.

- **Error Handling:** Validate inputs and handle errors gracefully.
