# Excel NUMBERVALUE Function

last modified April 4, 2025

The NUMBERVALUE function converts text representations of numbers
into actual numeric values. It's particularly useful for international data
with different decimal and group separators. This tutorial provides a
comprehensive guide to using NUMBERVALUE with detailed examples.
You'll learn its syntax, practical applications, and advanced techniques.

## NUMBERVALUE Function Basics

The NUMBERVALUE function converts text to numbers while allowing
custom decimal and group separators. It handles international number formats
and cleans text-based numeric data for calculations.

  
    Component
    Description
  
  
    Function Name
    NUMBERVALUE
  
  
    Syntax
    =NUMBERVALUE(text, [decimal_separator], [group_separator])
  
  
    Arguments
    Text (required), Decimal separator (optional), Group separator (optional)
  
  
    Return Value
    Numeric value converted from text
  

This table breaks down the essential components of NUMBERVALUE.
It shows the function name, syntax format, argument requirements, and return
value characteristics. The optional arguments make it flexible for various
number formats.

## Basic NUMBERVALUE Example

This example demonstrates the simplest use of NUMBERVALUE with standard
numeric text.

Basic NUMBERVALUE formula
  

=NUMBERVALUE("1234.56")

This formula converts the text "1234.56" to the numeric value 1234.56. It uses
the system's default decimal separator (period in US locales). The result can
then be used in calculations.

## NUMBERVALUE with Custom Decimal Separator

This example shows how to handle numbers using different decimal separators,
common in European formats.

  
    A
    B
  
  
    1234,56
    
  
  
    
    =NUMBERVALUE(A1, ",", ".")
  

The table shows a European-style number in cell A1 with comma as decimal
separator. The formula in B1 converts it to a proper number by specifying the
custom decimal separator.

NUMBERVALUE with comma decimal
  

=NUMBERVALUE("1234,56", ",", ".")

This formula converts "1234,56" to 1234.56 by specifying comma as the decimal
separator. The third argument (group separator) is set to period but isn't used
here. The result is a proper numeric value.

## NUMBERVALUE with Group Separators

This example demonstrates handling numbers with thousand separators, which
NUMBERVALUE can process by specifying the group separator.

  
    A
    B
  
  
    1,234.56
    
  
  
    
    =NUMBERVALUE(A1, ".", ",")
  

The table shows a number with thousand separators in cell A1. The formula in B1
converts it to a proper number by specifying comma as group separator and
period as decimal separator.

NUMBERVALUE with thousand separators
  

=NUMBERVALUE("1,234.56", ".", ",")

This formula converts "1,234.56" to 1234.56 by properly interpreting the comma
as thousand separator and period as decimal point. The group separator is
removed during conversion to create a proper numeric value.

## NUMBERVALUE with European Format

This example shows how to handle full European number format with swapped
decimal and group separators compared to US format.

  
    A
    B
  
  
    1.234,56
    
  
  
    
    =NUMBERVALUE(A1, ",", ".")
  

The table demonstrates a European-format number where period is thousand
separator and comma is decimal separator. The formula correctly interprets
this format by specifying the appropriate separators.

NUMBERVALUE with European format
  

=NUMBERVALUE("1.234,56", ",", ".")

This formula converts "1.234,56" to 1234.56 by using comma as decimal separator
and period as group separator. This is essential for processing international
financial data correctly in Excel.

## NUMBERVALUE with Currency Symbols

NUMBERVALUE can handle numbers with currency symbols or other non-numeric
prefixes/suffixes by ignoring them during conversion.

  
    A
    B
  
  
    $1,234.56
    
  
  
    €1.234,56
    
  
  
    
    =NUMBERVALUE(A1, ".", ",")
  
  
    
    =NUMBERVALUE(A2, ",", ".")
  

The table shows numbers with currency symbols in different formats. The formulas
in column B demonstrate how NUMBERVALUE ignores non-numeric characters while
respecting the specified number separators.

NUMBERVALUE with currency symbols
  

=NUMBERVALUE("$1,234.56", ".", ",")
=NUMBERVALUE("€1.234,56", ",", ".")

These formulas convert currency-formatted text to numbers while ignoring the
currency symbols. The first handles US format, the second European. Both
produce 1234.56 as the numeric result, ready for calculations.

## NUMBERVALUE with Percentage Values

This example demonstrates how NUMBERVALUE can convert percentage text to
decimal numbers by dividing by 100 during conversion.

  
    A
    B
  
  
    12,34%
    
  
  
    
    =NUMBERVALUE(A1, ",", ".")/100
  

The table shows a European-format percentage value. The formula divides the
result by 100 to convert from percentage to decimal, while properly handling
the comma decimal separator.

NUMBERVALUE with percentage
  

=NUMBERVALUE("12,34%", ",", ".")/100

This formula converts "12,34%" to 0.1234 by first converting the text to
12.34 then dividing by 100. This technique is useful for processing percentage
data from text sources.

The NUMBERVALUE function is essential for working with
international numeric data in Excel. It provides precise control over number
format interpretation, making it invaluable for data cleaning and preparation.
By mastering its various applications, you can handle virtually any text-based
number format conversion task in your spreadsheets.
