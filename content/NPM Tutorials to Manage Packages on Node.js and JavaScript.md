# ðŸ“¦ NPM Tutorials to Manage Packages on Node.js and JavaScript

## ðŸš€ What is NPM?
NPM is a package manager for JavaScript applications that allows developers to:

âœ… Create reusable packages, publish them to repositories, and share them with other applications.
âœ… Install and uninstall packages easily.
âœ… Update or downgrade packages as needed.

With npm, managing dependencies and sharing code across different projects becomes efficient and seamless. ðŸŽ¯
