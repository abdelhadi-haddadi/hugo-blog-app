# Python sqlite3.Cursor.fetchone Method

Last modified April 15, 2025

This comprehensive guide explores Python's sqlite3.Cursor.fetchone method,
the primary way to retrieve single rows from SQLite query results. We'll cover basic
usage, parameters, and practical examples.

## Basic Definitions

The fetchone method retrieves the next row from a query result set. It
returns a single sequence representing one row, or None when no more data is available.

Key characteristics: it's memory efficient for large result sets, maintains cursor
position, and works with any SELECT query. It's part of the DB-API 2.0 specification.

## Basic fetchone Usage

Here's the simplest usage of fetchone to retrieve a single row from
a database table.

basic_fetchone.py
  

import sqlite3

with sqlite3.connect('example.db') as conn:
    with conn.cursor() as cur:
        cur.execute("SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = 1")
        row = cur.fetchone()
        print(row)  # (1, 'Alice', 30)

This example shows the basic workflow: connect, create cursor, execute query,
fetch one row, and automatically close resources. The with statements ensure
proper cleanup.

The method returns a tuple representing the row's columns in query order. None
is returned if no rows match the query.

## Fetching Multiple Rows with fetchone

fetchone can be called repeatedly to process a result set row by row.
This is memory efficient for large result sets.

multiple_fetchone.py
  

import sqlite3

with sqlite3.connect('example.db') as conn:
    with conn.cursor() as cur:
        cur.execute("SELECT * FROM users ORDER BY name")
        while True:
            row = cur.fetchone()
            if row is None:
                break
            print(f"User: {row[1]}, Age: {row[2]}")

This pattern processes each row as it's fetched, without loading all results into
memory. The loop continues until fetchone returns None.

This approach is ideal for large datasets where memory conservation is important.

## Combining fetchone with Row Factory

Using a row factory with fetchone enables named column access for
better code readability.

row_factory_fetchone.py
  

import sqlite3

with sqlite3.connect('example.db') as conn:
    conn.row_factory = sqlite3.Row
    with conn.cursor() as cur:
        cur.execute("SELECT * FROM users WHERE age &gt; ?", (25,))
        row = cur.fetchone()
        if row:
            print(f"{row['name']} is {row['age']} years old")

The sqlite3.Row factory provides both index and name-based access to
columns. This makes code more maintainable and less prone to errors.

Named access is especially valuable when working with tables that have many
columns or when schema changes might occur.

## Handling Empty Result Sets

fetchone returns None when no rows match the query. This example
shows proper handling of empty results.

empty_results.py
  

import sqlite3

def get_user_age(user_id):
    with sqlite3.connect('example.db') as conn:
        with conn.cursor() as cur:
            cur.execute("SELECT age FROM users WHERE id = ?", (user_id,))
            row = cur.fetchone()
            return row[0] if row else None

age = get_user_age(999)
print(f"User age: {age if age is not None else 'not found'}")

This example safely handles cases where the query returns no rows. The ternary
operator checks if row exists before accessing its first column.

Always check for None when using fetchone to avoid AttributeError
exceptions.

## Fetchone with Parameterized Queries

Parameterized queries with fetchone prevent SQL injection and
improve performance through query reuse.

parameterized_fetchone.py
  

import sqlite3

def authenticate(username, password):
    with sqlite3.connect('users.db') as conn:
        with conn.cursor() as cur:
            query = "SELECT id FROM users WHERE username = ? AND password = ?"
            cur.execute(query, (username, password))
            return cur.fetchone() is not None

authenticated = authenticate('admin', 'secret123')
print("Login successful" if authenticated else "Invalid credentials")

This secure authentication example uses parameterized queries. The ? placeholders
are replaced safely with user input values.

Parameterized queries are essential for security and should always be used with
user-provided data.

## Fetchone in Transactions

fetchone works within transactions, allowing row-by-row processing
while maintaining data consistency.

transaction_fetchone.py
  

import sqlite3

with sqlite3.connect('inventory.db') as conn:
    conn.execute("BEGIN")
    try:
        with conn.cursor() as cur:
            cur.execute("SELECT id, quantity FROM products WHERE quantity &lt; 5")
            while True:
                row = cur.fetchone()
                if row is None:
                    break
                print(f"Low stock: Product {row[0]} has {row[1]} units")
                # Could update each product here
        conn.commit()
    except:
        conn.rollback()
        raise

This example processes low-stock products within a transaction. The explicit
BEGIN ensures all fetches see a consistent database state.

Transactions are important when fetching data that might be changed by other
database operations during processing.

## Fetchone with Custom Types

SQLite can convert fetched data to Python types using converters or detect_types.

custom_types_fetchone.py
  

import sqlite3
import json
from datetime import datetime

def parse_date(text):
    return datetime.strptime(text, '%Y-%m-%d').date()

with sqlite3.connect('data.db', detect_types=sqlite3.PARSE_DECLTYPES) as conn:
    conn.execute("CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS events (id INTEGER, details TEXT, event_date DATE)")
    conn.execute("INSERT INTO events VALUES (1, '{\"type\":\"meeting\"}', '2025-04-20')")
    conn.commit()
    
    with conn.cursor() as cur:
        cur.execute("SELECT * FROM events")
        row = cur.fetchone()
        print(f"Event on {row[2]}: {json.loads(row[1])['type']}")

This example shows type conversion during fetch. The DATE column is converted to
a Python date object, and JSON text is parsed.

Type detection and conversion can simplify data handling but may impact
performance for very large result sets.

## Best Practices

- **Always use with statements:** Ensures proper resource cleanup

- **Check for None:** Handle empty result sets gracefully

- **Use parameterized queries:** Prevent SQL injection

- **Consider memory usage:** fetchone is better than fetchall for large data

- **Use row factories:** For more readable column access
