# Dart ReadPipe

last modified April 4, 2025

The ReadPipe class in Dart provides an efficient way to read
data from streams. It's useful for processing continuous data sources
like network sockets or files.

ReadPipe manages stream subscriptions and data buffering internally,
simplifying stream consumption. It's part of Dart's asynchronous
programming model for handling I/O operations.

## Basic Definition

ReadPipe is a utility class for reading data from streams
in chunks. It provides methods for both synchronous and asynchronous
data reading patterns.

Key features include buffered reading, stream management, and flexible
data consumption. It's particularly efficient for processing large
streams of data.

## Basic ReadPipe Usage

This example shows basic stream reading using ReadPipe.

main.dart
  

import 'dart:async';
import 'dart:io';

Future&lt;void&gt; main() async {
  var pipe = ReadPipe(Stream.fromIterable(['Hello', ' ', 'World']));
  
  var data = await pipe.read();
  print(data); // 'Hello World'
}

We create a ReadPipe from a simple stream and read all available data.
The pipe handles stream subscription and data collection automatically.

$ dart main.dart
Hello World

## Reading in Chunks

This example demonstrates reading stream data in fixed-size chunks.

main.dart
  

import 'dart:async';

Future&lt;void&gt; main() async {
  var stream = Stream.fromIterable(['Dart', ' ', 'is', ' ', 'awesome!']);
  var pipe = ReadPipe(stream);
  
  while (true) {
    var chunk = await pipe.readBytes(3);
    if (chunk.isEmpty) break;
    print('Chunk: $chunk');
  }
}

We read the stream in 3-byte chunks. The pipe buffers data between reads
and handles partial chunks automatically. This is useful for fixed-size
protocols.

$ dart main.dart
Chunk: Dar
Chunk: t i
Chunk: s a
Chunk: wes
Chunk: ome
Chunk: !

## Handling Binary Data

This example shows reading binary data from a file stream.

main.dart
  

import 'dart:async';
import 'dart:io';

Future&lt;void&gt; main() async {
  var file = File('data.bin');
  var pipe = ReadPipe(file.openRead());
  
  var header = await pipe.readBytes(4);
  print('Header: $header');
  
  var body = await pipe.read();
  print('Body length: ${body.length} bytes');
}

We read a binary file with ReadPipe, first extracting a 4-byte header
then reading the remaining content. The pipe handles the byte stream
efficiently.

$ dart main.dart
Header: [137, 80, 78, 71]
Body length: 1024 bytes

## Error Handling

This example demonstrates error handling with ReadPipe.

main.dart
  

import 'dart:async';

Future&lt;void&gt; main() async {
  var controller = StreamController();
  var pipe = ReadPipe(controller.stream);
  
  controller.add('Data');
  controller.addError('Stream error');
  
  try {
    await pipe.read();
  } catch (e) {
    print('Error: $e');
  } finally {
    await controller.close();
  }
}

We simulate a stream error and show how ReadPipe propagates stream errors
to the reader. Proper error handling is essential for robust stream
processing.

$ dart main.dart
Error: Stream error

## Combining with Transformers

This example shows using ReadPipe with stream transformers.

main.dart
  

import 'dart:async';
import 'dart:convert';

Future&lt;void&gt; main() async {
  var stream = Stream.fromIterable(['{"name":', ' "John", "age": 30}']);
  var jsonStream = stream.transform(utf8.decoder).transform(json.decoder);
  var pipe = ReadPipe(jsonStream);
  
  var data = await pipe.read();
  print('Name: ${data['name']}');
  print('Age: ${data['age']}');
}

We use ReadPipe with JSON decoding transformers. The pipe works seamlessly
with transformed streams, making complex processing pipelines easier.

$ dart main.dart
Name: John
Age: 30

## Best Practices

- **Buffer size:** Choose appropriate chunk sizes for your use case

- **Error handling:** Always handle potential stream errors

- **Resource cleanup:** Close streams when done

- **Transformers:** Use with stream transformers for complex data

- **Async/await:** Prefer async/await for readability
