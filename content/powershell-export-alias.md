# PowerShell Export-Alias

last modified February 15, 2025

In this article, we will cover the Export-Alias cmdlet in
PowerShell. This cmdlet exports PowerShell aliases to a file for backup
or sharing purposes.

## Alias basics

An alias is a shortcut name for a cmdlet, function, or executable file.
PowerShell includes many built-in aliases like ls for Get-ChildItem. Aliases
save typing but can reduce script readability. The Export-Alias
cmdlet helps manage aliases by saving them to files.

## Basic Export-Alias usage

The simplest way to use Export-Alias exports all aliases to a
file. The -Path parameter specifies the output file location. By default,
the file is created in CSV format. This provides an easy way to back up
your aliases.

alias1.ps1
  

Export-Alias -Path "C:\temp\aliases.csv"

This command exports all current session aliases to aliases.csv. The file
contains alias name, definition, and description columns. You can import
these later using Import-Alias.

## Export specific aliases

You can export only specific aliases using the -Name parameter. This accepts
wildcards for pattern matching. It's useful when you want to export only
certain types of aliases. Multiple aliases can be specified separated by
commas.

alias2.ps1
  

Export-Alias -Path "C:\temp\get_aliases.csv" -Name "get-*"

This command exports all aliases starting with "get-". The output file will
contain aliases like get-childitem, get-content, etc. Wildcards make it easy
to group related aliases.

## Export to different formats

The Export-Alias cmdlet supports multiple output formats. Use the
-As parameter to specify format. Supported formats are CSV, Script, and
Clixml. Each format serves different purposes for alias management.

alias3.ps1
  

Export-Alias -Path "C:\temp\aliases.ps1" -As Script

This exports aliases as PowerShell script commands. The script can be run
later to recreate the aliases. Script format is useful for sharing aliases
with others who can execute the file.

## Append to existing file

By default, Export-Alias overwrites existing files. Use the
-Append parameter to add to existing files instead. This is helpful when
building alias collections from multiple sessions. The file format must
match for proper appending.

alias4.ps1
  

Export-Alias -Path "C:\temp\aliases.csv" -Append

This command adds new aliases to an existing aliases.csv file. If the file
doesn't exist, it will be created. The -NoClobber parameter prevents
overwriting existing files entirely.

## Export with description

The -Description parameter includes alias descriptions in the output. This
provides more context about each alias's purpose. Descriptions are
particularly useful for custom aliases. They help document why aliases
were created.

alias5.ps1
  

Export-Alias -Path "C:\temp\aliases_desc.csv" -Description

This exports all aliases with their descriptions included. The description
appears as an additional column in CSV output. For script format, comments
are added above each alias definition.

## Export with scope

PowerShell aliases can have different scopes (Global, Local, Script). The
-Scope parameter filters aliases by their scope. This helps organize aliases
based on where they're available. Global scope is most common for persistent
aliases.

alias6.ps1
  

Export-Alias -Path "C:\temp\global_aliases.csv" -Scope Global

This command exports only aliases in the Global scope. Global aliases persist
across sessions when properly saved. The output file won't include local or
script-scoped aliases.

## Export with force

The -Force parameter allows overwriting read-only files. It also suppresses
confirmation prompts for existing files. This is useful in automated scripts
where interaction isn't possible. Use with caution as it can overwrite
important files.

alias7.ps1
  

Export-Alias -Path "C:\temp\aliases.csv" -Force

This command will overwrite aliases.csv even if it's read-only. No prompts
will appear if the file exists. Combine with -NoClobber to prevent any
overwriting while still forcing other operations.
