# Kotlin Extension Functions

last modified March 22, 2025

Kotlin extension functions let you bolt new tricks onto existing classes
without touching their blueprints—perfect for jazzing up libraries or third-party
code you can't tweak. This tutorial unpacks extension functions with vivid,
real-world examples that bring their power to life.

## Basic Extension Function

An extension function slips into a class by prefixing its name with the target
type. Here's a simple twist that adds a welcome function to
String, giving it a friendly voice.

BasicExtension.kt
  

fun String.welcome(): String {
    return "Welcome, $this, to the team!"
}

fun main() {
    val user = "Alice"
    println(user.welcome())
}

welcome spices up String with a greeting, using
this to reference the string. Imagine this in an HR app, greeting
new hires with flair—no class edits needed.

## Extension Function with Parameters

Extension functions can grab parameters to flex their muscles. This one adds a
shout function to String, letting you amplify text on
demand.

ExtensionWithParams.kt
  

fun String.shout(times: Int): String {
    return this.uppercase() + "!".repeat(times)
}

fun main() {
    val alert = "warning"
    println(alert.shout(3))
}

shout takes a times parameter, boosting the string
with exclamations. Picture this in a notification system, turning "warning"
into a loud alert—customizable and snappy.

## Extension Function for Collections

Collections like List can gain new powers too. This example crafts
a rotate function to shuffle list items, keeping things fresh.

CollectionExtension.kt
  

fun &lt;T&gt; List&lt;T&gt;.rotate(shift: Int): List&lt;T&gt; {
    val size = this.size
    if (size == 0) return this
    val normalizedShift = (shift % size + size) % size
    return this.drop(normalizedShift) + this.take(normalizedShift)
}

fun main() {
    val tasks = listOf("Code", "Test", "Deploy")
    println(tasks.rotate(1))
}

rotate shifts list elements, handling edge cases with modulo.
Think of a task scheduler cycling priorities—rotating "Code" to the back keeps
your workflow humming without altering the original List.

## Extension Function for Nullable Types

Nullable types get love too, with extensions that handle null
gracefully. This adds a safeTrim function to String?,
tidying up without tripping over nothing.

NullableExtension.kt
  

fun String?.safeTrim(): String {
    return this?.trim() ?: ""
}

fun main() {
    val input: String? = null
    println(input.safeTrim())
}

safeTrim trims a nullable string, defaulting to empty if
null. Perfect for a form processor cleaning user input—null or not,
it's handled smoothly with Kotlin's Elvis operator.

## Extension Function for Custom Classes

Custom classes can sprout new abilities too. Here, a Person class
gains a needsID check to flag minors needing extra checks.

CustomClassExtension.kt
  

class Person(val name: String, val age: Int)

fun Person.needsID(): Boolean {
    return this.age &lt; 21
}

fun main() {
    val guest = Person("Bob", 19)
    println(guest.needsID())
}

needsID tags Person with a minor check. Imagine this
at a venue gate, flagging guests under 21 for ID verification—cleanly bolted
onto the class without rewriting it.

## Extension Function for Companion Objects

Companion objects can level up with extensions, enhancing static-like
behavior. This adds a fromEmail factory to User's
companion.

CompanionObjectExtension.kt
  

class User(val username: String) {
    companion object
}

fun User.Companion.fromEmail(email: String): User {
    return User(email.substringBefore("@"))
}

fun main() {
    val user = User.fromEmail("alice@site.com")
    println(user.username)
}

fromEmail crafts a User from an email, snipping the
username. Think signup flows—extracting a handle from an email without
cluttering the User class itself.

## Extension Function for Generic Types

Generic types bend to extensions too, offering reusable tricks across types.
This adds a summarize function to List for quick stats.

GenericExtension.kt
  

fun &lt;T&gt; List&lt;T&gt;.summarize(): String {
    return "Count: ${this.size}, Items: ${this.joinToString()}"
}

fun main() {
    val scores = listOf(85, 92, 78)
    println(scores.summarize())
}

summarize tallies and lists any List. Picture a quiz
app spitting out a score recap—generic, concise, and ready for any data type.

## Extension with Lambda

Extensions can wield lambdas for dynamic behavior, letting callers shape the
action. This adds a transform function to String.

LambdaExtension.kt
  

fun String.transform(action: (String) -&gt; String): String {
    return action(this)
}

fun main() {
    val text = "hello"
    println(text.transform { it.capitalize() })
}

transform hands off the string to a lambda, here capitalizing it.
Think text editors—users pick the tweak (capitalize, reverse), and the
extension delivers, all without touching String.

## Chaining Extensions

Extensions can chain, stacking effects for sleek workflows. This pairs
mask and shorten on String.

ChainingExtension.kt
  

fun String.mask(): String = this.replaceRange(1, length - 1, "*".repeat(length - 2))
fun String.shorten(max: Int): String = if (length &lt;= max) this else substring(0, max) + "..."

fun main() {
    val email = "alice@site.com"
    println(email.mask().shorten(10))
}

mask hides middle chars, then shorten caps length.
Ideal for a privacy filter—obscuring emails in logs, then trimming for display,
all in a fluid chain.

## Extension with Receiver Scope

Extensions can tap the receiver's scope for richer logic. This adds
logSelf to Any, logging with type info.

ReceiverScopeExtension.kt
  

fun Any.logSelf(): String {
    return "Log: ${this::class.simpleName} = $this"
}

fun main() {
    val num = 42
    println(num.logSelf())
}

logSelf uses this and its class name for a log entry.
Great for debugging—any object can report itself with type context, no subclassing
required.

## Best Practices for Using Extension Functions

**Keep It Tight:** Craft lean extensions for focused tasks,
like safeTrim, not sprawling logic bombs.
**Don't Overdo It:** Sprinkle extensions judiciously—too many
can muddy your codebase's clarity.
**Name with Care:** Pick vivid names like
needsID over vague ones like check—intent shines
through.
**Honor Boundaries:** Steer clear of private fields; respect
the class's secrets to avoid fragile hacks.
