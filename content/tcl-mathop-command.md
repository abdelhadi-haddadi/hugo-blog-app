# Tcl mathop Command

last modified April 3, 2025

The Tcl mathop command provides efficient mathematical operations. 
It offers better performance than expr for simple operations. 
The command supports various arithmetic and bitwise operations. It's useful 
for performance-critical code sections.

## Basic Definition

The mathop command performs mathematical operations on arguments. 
It evaluates operations directly without string parsing overhead. The command 
supports both binary and unary operations. It returns the result of the operation.

Syntax: mathop op ?arg ...?. The op specifies the 
operation to perform. Arguments are the values to operate on. The command 
supports all standard mathematical operations.

## Basic Arithmetic Operations

This example demonstrates basic arithmetic operations with mathop.

basic_mathop.tcl
  

set a 10
set b 3

puts "Addition: [mathop + $a $b]"
puts "Subtraction: [mathop - $a $b]"
puts "Multiplication: [mathop * $a $b]"
puts "Division: [mathop / $a $b]"

This shows addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The 
mathop command performs each operation efficiently. Results 
are printed using puts.

## Bitwise Operations

mathop supports various bitwise operations for integer values.

bitwise_mathop.tcl
  

set x 0b1010
set y 0b1100

puts "AND: [format %b [mathop &amp; $x $y]]"
puts "OR: [format %b [mathop | $x $y]]"
puts "XOR: [format %b [mathop ^ $x $y]]"
puts "Left shift: [format %b [mathop &lt;&lt; $x 1]]"

This demonstrates bitwise AND, OR, XOR, and left shift operations. The 
results are formatted as binary strings for clarity. mathop 
handles these operations efficiently.

## Comparison Operations

mathop can perform comparison operations returning boolean results.

comparison_mathop.tcl
  

set val1 15
set val2 20

puts "Greater than: [mathop &gt; $val1 $val2]"
puts "Less than: [mathop &lt; $val1 $val2]"
puts "Equal: [mathop == $val1 $val2]"
puts "Not equal: [mathop != $val1 $val2]"

This shows numeric comparison operations. Each operation returns 1 for true 
or 0 for false. The results are printed directly to standard output.

## Unary Operations

mathop supports several unary operations on single arguments.

unary_mathop.tcl
  

set num 5

puts "Negation: [mathop - $num]"
puts "Bitwise NOT: [mathop ~ $num]"
puts "Absolute value: [mathop abs -7]"
puts "Square root: [mathop sqrt 16]"

This demonstrates unary operations including negation, bitwise NOT, absolute 
value, and square root. Each operation is performed on a single argument. 
Results are printed immediately.

## Multiple Operations

mathop can be nested to perform multiple operations in sequence.

nested_mathop.tcl
  

set x 4
set y 2
set z 3

set result [mathop + [mathop * $x $y] [mathop / $z $y]]
puts "Result: $result"

This example shows nested mathop commands. It calculates (x*y)+(z/y). 
The innermost operations are evaluated first. The final result is stored and printed.

## Floating-Point Operations

mathop handles floating-point numbers with standard operations.

float_mathop.tcl
  

set pi 3.14159
set radius 2.5

set area [mathop * [mathop * $pi $radius] $radius]
puts "Circle area: $area"

This calculates the area of a circle using floating-point numbers. The formula 
πr² is implemented with nested mathop commands. The result is 
printed with full precision.

## Best Practices

- **Performance:** Use mathop instead of expr for simple operations.

- **Readability:** For complex expressions, expr may be clearer.

- **Precision:** Be aware of integer vs floating-point operations.

- **Error handling:** Check for division by zero and other edge cases.

- **Documentation:** Document complex operations for maintenance.
