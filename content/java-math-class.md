# Java Math Class

Last modified: April 13, 2025

 

The java.lang.Math class provides static methods for performing 
various mathematical operations. These include exponential, logarithmic, 
trigonometric, rounding, and random number functions. Since all methods 
are static, the class cannot be instantiated.

The Math class works with primitive types like double and 
int. For applications requiring higher precision, consider 
using BigDecimal, which offers better accuracy for financial 
calculations and scientific computations.

This class also defines two essential constants: Math.PI, the 
mathematical constant for π (~3.14159), and Math.E, the base of 
the natural logarithm (~2.71828). These constants are widely used in geometry, 
physics, and numerical analysis.

## Math Class Overview

The Math class provides methods for basic arithmetic, trigonometry, 
exponentiation, logarithms, rounding, and random number generation. 
Since all methods are static and thread-safe, they can be used without 
object creation and are safe for concurrent operations.

This class belongs to the java.lang package, meaning it's automatically 
imported in all Java programs, allowing immediate access to its functionalities 
without explicit import statements.

## Basic Arithmetic Operations

The Math class provides methods for basic arithmetic operations like absolute
value, maximum/minimum values, and square roots. These methods are optimized
for performance and handle edge cases properly.

Main.java
  

package com.zetcode;

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        
        // Absolute value
        int absValue = Math.abs(-15);
        System.out.println("Absolute value of -15: " + absValue);
        
        // Maximum and minimum
        int max = Math.max(10, 20);
        int min = Math.min(10, 20);
        System.out.println("Max of 10 and 20: " + max);
        System.out.println("Min of 10 and 20: " + min);
        
        // Square root
        double sqrt = Math.sqrt(25);
        System.out.println("Square root of 25: " + sqrt);
        
        // Power
        double power = Math.pow(2, 3);
        System.out.println("2 raised to power 3: " + power);
    }
}

This example demonstrates basic arithmetic operations. Math.abs
returns the absolute value, Math.max/min compare values,
Math.sqrt calculates square roots, and Math.pow
handles exponents. All methods are straightforward to use.

## Trigonometric Functions

The Math class provides standard trigonometric functions including sine, cosine,
and tangent. These methods take angles in radians. For degree conversion, use
Math.toRadians or Math.toDegrees.

Main.java
  

package com.zetcode;

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        
        // Convert 30 degrees to radians
        double radians = Math.toRadians(30);
        System.out.println("30 degrees in radians: " + radians);
        
        // Trigonometric functions
        double sinValue = Math.sin(radians);
        double cosValue = Math.cos(radians);
        double tanValue = Math.tan(radians);
        
        System.out.println("Sine of 30°: " + sinValue);
        System.out.println("Cosine of 30°: " + cosValue);
        System.out.println("Tangent of 30°: " + tanValue);
        
        // Inverse trigonometric functions
        double asinValue = Math.asin(sinValue);
        System.out.println("Arcsine of sin(30°): " + 
                          Math.toDegrees(asinValue) + "°");
    }
}

This example shows trigonometric operations. We first convert degrees to radians,
then calculate sine, cosine, and tangent. The inverse functions return results
in radians which we convert back to degrees for readability.

## Exponential and Logarithmic Functions

The Math class provides methods for exponential and logarithmic calculations.
Math.exp computes e^x, while Math.log computes
natural logarithms (base e). For base 10 logarithms, use Math.log10.

Main.java
  

package com.zetcode;

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        
        // Exponential function
        double expValue = Math.exp(1);
        System.out.println("e^1: " + expValue);
        System.out.println("Math.E: " + Math.E);
        
        // Natural logarithm
        double logValue = Math.log(Math.E);
        System.out.println("ln(e): " + logValue);
        
        // Base 10 logarithm
        double log10Value = Math.log10(100);
        System.out.println("log10(100): " + log10Value);
        
        // Combining operations
        double result = Math.pow(2, Math.log10(100));
        System.out.println("2^log10(100): " + result);
    }
}

This example demonstrates exponential and logarithmic functions. We show the
relationship between Math.exp and Math.log, and how
they relate to the constant Math.E. The example also shows how to
combine these operations with other Math methods.

## Rounding Methods

The Math class provides several rounding methods with different behaviors.
Math.round performs standard rounding, while Math.ceil
always rounds up and Math.floor always rounds down.

Main.java
  

package com.zetcode;

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        
        double num1 = 3.4;
        double num2 = 3.6;
        double num3 = -3.4;
        
        // Standard rounding
        System.out.println("Round 3.4: " + Math.round(num1));
        System.out.println("Round 3.6: " + Math.round(num2));
        
        // Ceiling (round up)
        System.out.println("Ceil 3.4: " + Math.ceil(num1));
        System.out.println("Ceil -3.4: " + Math.ceil(num3));
        
        // Floor (round down)
        System.out.println("Floor 3.6: " + Math.floor(num2));
        System.out.println("Floor -3.4: " + Math.floor(num3));
        
        // Truncate using casting
        System.out.println("Truncate 3.6: " + (int) num2);
    }
}

This example shows different rounding approaches. Math.round follows
standard rounding rules, while Math.ceil and Math.floor
always round in specific directions. The example also shows how casting can be
used for truncation.

## Random Number Generation

The Math.random method generates pseudorandom numbers between 0.0
(inclusive) and 1.0 (exclusive). For more control over random numbers, consider
using the Random class from java.util package.

Main.java
  

package com.zetcode;

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        
        // Simple random number
        double random1 = Math.random();
        System.out.println("Random between 0 and 1: " + random1);
        
        // Random number in range
        int min = 10;
        int max = 20;
        int randomInRange = (int) (Math.random() * (max - min + 1)) + min;
        System.out.println("Random between 10 and 20: " + randomInRange);
        
        // Multiple random numbers
        System.out.println("\nFive random numbers:");
        for (int i = 0; i &lt; 5; i++) {
            System.out.println(Math.random());
        }
    }
}

This example demonstrates random number generation. We show how to get a simple
random number and how to scale it to a specific range. The formula for range
scaling is important for practical applications of random numbers.

## Mathematical Constants

The Math class provides two important mathematical constants: Math.PI
(π) and Math.E (base of natural logarithms). These constants are
defined with high precision and are useful in many mathematical calculations.

Main.java
  

package com.zetcode;

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        
        // Circle calculations using PI
        double radius = 5.0;
        double circumference = 2 * Math.PI * radius;
        double area = Math.PI * Math.pow(radius, 2);
        
        System.out.println("Circle with radius 5:");
        System.out.println("Circumference: " + circumference);
        System.out.println("Area: " + area);
        
        // Exponential growth using E
        double initial = 100;
        double rate = 0.05;
        double time = 10;
        double finalAmount = initial * Math.exp(rate * time);
        
        System.out.println("\nExponential growth:");
        System.out.println("Initial: " + initial);
        System.out.println("Final after 10 years at 5%: " + finalAmount);
    }
}

This example shows practical uses of mathematical constants. We calculate circle
properties using Math.PI and model exponential growth using
Math.E. These constants are essential for many scientific and
engineering calculations.

## Advanced Mathematical Operations

The Math class also provides more advanced operations like hyperbolic functions,
angle conversions, and IEEE remainder. These methods are useful for specialized
mathematical computations.

Main.java
  

package com.zetcode;

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        
        // Hyperbolic functions
        double x = 1.0;
        System.out.println("sinh(1.0): " + Math.sinh(x));
        System.out.println("cosh(1.0): " + Math.cosh(x));
        System.out.println("tanh(1.0): " + Math.tanh(x));
        
        // IEEE remainder
        System.out.println("\nIEEE remainder:");
        System.out.println("IEEEremainder(10, 3): " + 
                          Math.IEEEremainder(10, 3));
        System.out.println("10 % 3: " + (10 % 3));
        
        // Copy sign
        System.out.println("\nCopy sign:");
        System.out.println("copySign(5.0, -1.0): " + 
                          Math.copySign(5.0, -1.0));
        System.out.println("copySign(-5.0, 1.0): " + 
                          Math.copySign(-5.0, 1.0));
    }
}

This example demonstrates advanced Math class operations. Hyperbolic functions
are similar to trigonometric functions but based on hyperbolas. The IEEE
remainder differs from the modulo operator in how it handles negative numbers.
copySign is useful for manipulating number signs.
