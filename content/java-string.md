# Java String

last modified July 4, 2024

 

In this article we show how to work with strings in Java using String and
StringBuilder.

## Definition

In Java, a string is a sequence of Unicode characters. Strings are objects.
There are two basic classes for working with strings:

- String

- StringBuilder

String is an immutable sequence of characters.
StringBuilder is a mutable sequence of characters. (There is also a
StringBuffer class which can be used by multiple threads. If we are
not dealing with threads, we use the
StringBuilder.)

A *string literal* a series of characters in the source code that is
enclosed in double quotes. For example, "Java" is a string literal. Whenever
Java compiler encounters a string literal in the code, it creates a String
object with its value.

String lang = "Java"; // same as String lang = new String("Java");

String literals are used by many programming languages. It is an established
convention and it also saves typing.

## Initializing strings

There are multiple ways of creating strings, both immutable and mutable.
We will show a few of them.

Main.java
  

void main() {

    char[] cdb = {'M', 'y', 'S', 'Q', 'L'};

    String lang = "Java";
    String ide = new String("NetBeans");
    String db = new String(cdb);

    System.out.println(lang);
    System.out.println(ide);
    System.out.println(db);

    StringBuilder sb1 = new StringBuilder(lang);
    StringBuilder sb2 = new StringBuilder();
    sb2.append("Fields");
    sb2.append(" of ");
    sb2.append("glory");

    System.out.println(sb1);
    System.out.println(sb2);
}

The example shows a few ways of creating String and
StringBuilder objects.

String lang = "Java";

The most common way is to create a string object from a string literal.

String ide = new String("NetBeans");

In this line, we create a string using the usual way of building objects ‚Äî with
the new keyword.

String db = new String(cdb);

Here we create a string object from an array of characters.

StringBuilder sb1 = new StringBuilder(lang);

A StringBuilder object is created from a String.

StringBuilder sb2 = new StringBuilder();
sb2.append("Fields");
sb2.append(" of ");
sb2.append("glory");

We create an empty StringBuilder object. We append three strings
into the object.

$ java Main.java
Java
NetBeans
MySQL
Java
Fields of glory

## String is an object

Strings are objects; they are not primitive data types. Strings are
instances of the String or StringBuilder class.
Since they are objects, they have multiple methods available for doing
various work.

Main.java
  

void main() {

    String lang = "Java";

    String bclass = lang.getClass().toString();
    System.out.println(bclass);

    String sup = lang.getClass().getSuperclass().toString();
    System.out.println(sup);

    if (lang.isEmpty()) {

        System.out.println("The string is empty");
    } else {

        System.out.println("The string is not empty");
    }

    int n = lang.length();
    System.out.println("The string has " + n + " characters");
}

In this program, we demonstrate that strings are objects. Objects must
have a class name, a parent class, and they must also have some methods
that we can call.

String lang = "Java";

An object of String type is created.

String bclass = lang.getClass().toString();

We determine the class name of the object to which the lang
variable refers.

String sup = lang.getClass().getSuperclass().toString();

A parent class of our object is received. All objects have at least one
parent ‚Äî the Object.

if (lang.isEmpty()) {

    System.out.println("The string is empty");
} else {

    System.out.println("The string is not empty");
}

Objects have various methods. One of the useful string methods is the
isEmpty method, which determines whether the string is empty.

int n = lang.length();

The length method returns the size of the string.

$ java Main.java
class java.lang.String
class java.lang.Object
The string is not empty
The string has 4 characters

Our string object is an instance of the String class. It has
the Object parent
class. The object is not empty and it contains four characters.

## String length

It is not easy to determine the length of a Unicode string. The
length method works only for certain Unicode characters.

Main.java
  

import java.text.BreakIterator;

void main() {

    var text1 = "falcon";
    var n1 = text1.length();

    System.out.printf("%s has %d characters%n", text1, n1);

    System.out.println("----------------------------");

    var text2 = "–≤–∏—à–Ω—è";
    var n2 = text2.length();
    System.out.printf("%s has %d characters%n", text2, n2);

    System.out.println("----------------------------");

    var text3 = "üê∫ü¶äü¶ù";
    var n3 = text3.length();
    System.out.printf("%s has %d characters%n", text3, n3);

    var n3_ = graphemeLength(text3);
    System.out.printf("%s has %d characters%n", text3, n3_);

    System.out.println("----------------------------");

    var text4 = "‡§®‡§Æ‡§∏‡•ç‡§§‡•á";

    var n4 = text4.length();
    System.out.printf("%s has %d characters%n", text4, n4);

    var n4_ = graphemeLength(text4);
    System.out.printf("%s has %d characters%n", text4, n4_);
}

int graphemeLength(String text) {

    BreakIterator it = BreakIterator.getCharacterInstance();
    it.setText(text);

    int count = 0;

    while (it.next() != BreakIterator.DONE) {
        count++;
    }

    return count;
}

In the example, we try to determine the length of various text.

var text1 = "falcon";
var n1 = text1.length();

For basic latin characters, the length method works OK.

var text2 = "–≤–∏—à–Ω—è";
var n2 = text2.length();

It also works OK for this cyrillic text.

var text3 = "üê∫ü¶äü¶ù";
var n3 = text3.length();

For emojis, we get a wrong result with length.

var n3_ = graphemeLength(text3);

With BreakIterator used in graphemeLength, we get
the correct result for emojis.

var text4 = "‡§®‡§Æ‡§∏‡•ç‡§§‡•á";

var n4 = text4.length();
System.out.printf("%s has %d characters%n", text4, n4);

var n4_ = graphemeLength(text4);
System.out.printf("%s has %d characters%n", text4, n4_);

In Java 20 the BreakIterator has been enhanced to return the
correct value for Sanscrit. (The appropriate value is four characters.)

$ java Main.java
falcon has 6 characters
----------------------------
–≤–∏—à–Ω—è has 5 characters
----------------------------
üê∫ü¶äü¶ù has 6 characters
üê∫ü¶äü¶ù has 3 characters
----------------------------
‡§®‡§Æ‡§∏‡•ç‡§§‡•á has 6 characters
‡§®‡§Æ‡§∏‡•ç‡§§‡•á has 4 characters

## Mutable &amp; immutable strings

The String is a sequence of immutable characters, while the
StringBuilder is a sequence of mutable characters. The next example
will show the difference.

Main.java
  

void main() {

    String name = "Jane";
    String name2 = name.replace('J', 'K');
    String name3 = name2.replace('n', 't');

    System.out.println(name);
    System.out.println(name3);

    StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder("Jane");
    System.out.println(sb);

    sb.setCharAt(0, 'K');
    sb.setCharAt(2, 't');

    System.out.println(sb);
}

Both objects have methods for replacing characters in a string.

String name = "Jane";
String name2 = name.replace('J', 'K');
String name3 = name2.replace('n', 't');

Calling the replace method on a String results in
returning a new modified string. The original string is not changed.

sb.setCharAt(0, 'K');
sb.setCharAt(2, 't');

The setCharAt method of a StringBuilder will replace a
character at the given index with a new character. The original string is
modified.

$ java Main.java
Jane
Kate
Jane
Kate

## The isBlank method

The isBlank method returns true if the string is empty or contains
only white space.

Main.java
  

import java.util.List;

void main() {

    var data = List.of("sky", "\n\n", "  ", "blue", "\t\t", "", "sky");

    for (int i=0; i&lt;data.size(); i++) {

        var e = data.get(i);

        if (e.isBlank()) {
            System.out.printf("element with index %d is blank%n", i);
        } else {

            System.out.println(data.get(i));
        }
    }
}

We go through a list of strings and print all blank elements.

$ java Main.java
sky
element with index 1 is blank
element with index 2 is blank
blue
element with index 4 is blank
element with index 5 is blank
sky

## Concatenating strings

Immutable strings can be added using the + operator or the concat
method. They will form a new string which is a chain of all concatenated
strings. Mutable strings have the append method which builds a
string from any number of other strings.

Main.java
  

void main() {

    System.out.println("Return" + " of " + "the king.");
    System.out.println("Return".concat(" of ").concat("the king."));

    StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
    sb.append("Return");
    sb.append(" of ");
    sb.append("the king.");

    System.out.println(sb);
}

The example creates three sentences by adding strings.

System.out.println("Return" + " of " + "the king.");

A new string is formed by using the + operator.

System.out.println("Return".concat(" of ").concat("the king."));

The concat method returns a string that represents the
concatenation of this object's characters followed by the string argument's
characters.

StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
sb.append("Return");
sb.append(" of ");
sb.append("the king.");

A mutable object of the StringBuilder type is created
by calling the append method three times.

$ java Main.java
Return of the king.
Return of the king.
Return of the king.

## Using quotes

In certain cases, such as using direct speech, the inner quotes must
be escaped.

Main.java
  

void main() {

    System.out.println("There are may stars");
    System.out.println("He said: \"Which one are you looking at?\"");
}

We use the \ character to escape additional quotes.

$ java Main.java
There are may stars
He said: "Which one are you looking at?"

## Multiline strings

Text blocks allow to define multiline strings. To create a multiline string, we
use triple quotes.

Main.java
  

String lyrics = """
    I cheated myself
    like I knew I would
    I told ya, I was trouble
    you know that I'm no good""";

void main() {

    System.out.println(lyrics);
}

We have a strophe that spans four lines.

$ java Main.java
I cheated myself
like I knew I would
I told ya, I was trouble
you know that I'm no good

Before text blocks were introduced, we had to do a concatenation operation and
use the \n character.

Main.java
  

String lyrics = "I cheated myself\n" +
    "like I knew I would\n" +
    "I told ya, I was trouble\n" +
    "you know that I'm no good";

void main() {

    System.out.println(lyrics);
}

The four strings are concatenated with the + operator.

## String elements

A string is a sequence of characters. A character is a basic element
of a string. The following two examples show some methods that
work with characters of a string.

Main.java
  

void main() {

    char[] crs = {'Z', 'e', 't', 'C', 'o', 'd', 'e' };
    String s = new String(crs);

    char c1 = s.charAt(0);
    char c2 = s.charAt(s.length()-1);

    System.out.println(c1);
    System.out.println(c2);

    int i1 = s.indexOf('e');
    int i2 = s.lastIndexOf('e');

    System.out.println("The first index of character e is " + i1);
    System.out.println("The last index of character e is " + i2);

    System.out.println(s.contains("t"));
    System.out.println(s.contains("f"));

    char[] elements = s.toCharArray();

    for (char el : elements) {

        System.out.println(el);
    }
}

In the first example, we will work with an immutable string.

char[] crs = {'Z', 'e', 't', 'C', 'o', 'd', 'e' };
String s = new String(crs);

A new immutable string is formed from an array of characters.

char c1 = s.charAt(0);
char c2 = s.charAt(s.length()-1);

With the charAt method, we get the first and the last
char value of the string.

int i1 = s.indexOf('e');
int i2 = s.lastIndexOf('e');

With the indexOf and lastIndexOf methods,
we get the first and the last occurrence of the character 'e'.

System.out.println(s.contains("t"));

With the contains method, we check if the string contains
the t character. The method returns a boolean value.

char[] elements = s.toCharArray();

for (char el : elements) {

    System.out.println(el);
}

The toCharArray method  creates a character array
from the string. We go through the array and print each of the
characters.

$ java Main.java
Z
e
The first index of character e is 1
The last index of character e is 6
true
false
Z
e
t
C
o
d
e

In the second example, we work with the elements of a StringBuilder
class.

Main.java
  

void main() {

    StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder("Misty mountains");
    System.out.println(sb);

    sb.deleteCharAt(sb.length()-1);
    System.out.println(sb);

    sb.append('s');
    System.out.println(sb);

    sb.insert(0, 'T');
    sb.insert(1, 'h');
    sb.insert(2, 'e');
    sb.insert(3, ' ');
    System.out.println(sb);

    sb.setCharAt(4, 'm');
    System.out.println(sb);
}

A mutable string is formed. We modify the contents of the string by
deleting, appending, inserting, and replacing characters.

sb.deleteCharAt(sb.length()-1);

This line deletes the last character.

sb.append('s');

The deleted character is appended back to the string.

sb.insert(0, 'T');
sb.insert(1, 'h');
sb.insert(2, 'e');
sb.insert(3, ' ');

We insert four characters at the beginning of the string.

sb.setCharAt(4, 'm');

Finally, we replace a character at index 4.

$ java Main.java
Misty mountains
Misty mountain
Misty mountains
The Misty mountains
The misty mountains

## The repeat method

The repeat method returns a string that is repeated n times.

Main.java
  

void main() {

    var word = "falcon ";

    var output = word.repeat(5);
    System.out.println(output);
}

In the example, we repeat the word five times.

$ java Main.java
falcon falcon falcon falcon falcon

## The lines method

The lines method returns a stream of lines extracted from the
string, separated by line terminators.

Main.java
  

void main() {

    var words = """
            club
            sky
            blue
            cup
            coin
            new
            cent
            owl
            falcon
            brave
            war
            ice
            paint
            water
            """;

    var wstream = words.lines();

    wstream.forEach(word -&gt; {

        if (word.length() == 3) {
            System.out.println(word);
        }
    });
}

We have fourteen words in the text block.

var wstream = words.lines();

With the lines method we create a stream of these words.

wstream.forEach(word -&gt; {

    if (word.length() == 3) {
        System.out.println(word);
    }
});

We go over the stream with forEach and print all words having
length of three letters.

$ java Main.java
sky
cup
new
owl
war
ice

## The startsWith method

The startsWith checks if the string starts with the given prefix.

Main.java
  

void main() {

    var words = "club\nsky\nblue\ncup\ncoin\nnew\ncent\nowl\nfalcon\nwar\nice";

    var wstream = words.lines();
    wstream.forEach(word -&gt; {

        if (word.startsWith("c")) {
            System.out.println(word);
        }
    });
}

We have a couple of words in a string. We print all words that start with letter
c.

$ java Main.java
club
cup
coin
cent

## The endsWith method

The endsWith method checks if the string ends with the specified
suffix.

Main.java
  

void main() {

    var words = "club\nsky\nblue\ncup\ncoin\nnew\ncent\nowl\nfalcon\nwar\nice";

    var wstream = words.lines();
    wstream.forEach(word -&gt; {

        if (word.endsWith("n") || word.endsWith("y")) {
            System.out.println(word);
        }
    });
}

In the example, we print all words that end either with n or
y.

$ java Main.java
sky
coin
falcon

## The toUpperCase/toLowerCase methods

The toUpperCase method converts all of the characters of the string
to upper case. The toLowerCase method converts all of the
characters of the string to lower case.

Main.java
  

void main() {

    var word1 = "Cherry";

    var u_word1 = word1.toUpperCase();
    var l_word1 = u_word1.toLowerCase();

    System.out.println(u_word1);
    System.out.println(l_word1);

    var word2 = "ƒåere≈°≈àa";

    var u_word2 = word2.toUpperCase();
    var l_word2 = u_word2.toLowerCase();

    System.out.println(u_word2);
    System.out.println(l_word2);
}

We modify the case of two words.

$ java Main.java
CHERRY
cherry
ƒåERE≈†≈áA
ƒçere≈°≈àa

## The matches method

The matches method tells whether or not the string matches the
given regular expression.

Main.java
  

void main() {

    var words = """
            book
            bookshelf
            bookworm
            bookcase
            bookish
            bookkeeper
            booklet
            bookmark
            """;

    var wstream = words.lines();

    wstream.forEach(word -&gt; {
        if (word.matches("book(worm|mark|keeper)?")) {
            System.out.println(word);
        }
    });
}

In the example, we print all the words that satisfy the specified subpatterns.

$ java Main.java
book
bookworm
bookkeeper
bookmark

## Palindrome example

A palindrome is a word, number, phrase, or other sequence of characters which
reads the same backward as forward, such as madam or racecar. There are many
ways to check if a string is a palindrome. The following example is one of the
possible solutions.

Main.java
  

// A palindrome is a word, number, phrase, or other sequence of characters
// which reads the same backward as forward, such as madam or racecar

void main() {

    System.out.println(isPalindrome("radar"));
    System.out.println(isPalindrome("kayak"));
    System.out.println(isPalindrome("forest"));
}

boolean isPalindrome(String original) {

    char[] data = original.toCharArray();

    int i = 0;
    int j = data.length - 1;

    while (j &gt; i) {

        if (data[i] != data[j]) {
            return false;
        }

        ++i;
        --j;
    }

    return true;
}

We have an implementation of the isPalindrome method.

boolean isPalindrome(String original) {

    char[] data = original.toCharArray();
...
}

We turn the string into a array of characters.

int i = 0;
int j = data.length - 1;

while (j &gt; i) {

    if (data[i] != data[j]) {
        return false;
    }

    ++i;
    --j;
}

return true;

We iterate through the array and compare the left side characters with the right
side corresponding characters. If all match, we return
true, otherwise we return false.

$ java Main.java
true
true
false

## Substrings

The substring method returns a part of a string. The beginning
index is inclusive, the ending index is exclusive. The beginning index starts
from zero.

Main.java
  

void main() {

    String str = "bookcase";

    System.out.println(str.substring(0, 4));
    System.out.println(str.substring(4, str.length()));
}

The example uses the substring method to create two substrings.

System.out.println(str.substring(0, 4));

Here we get the "book" substring. The zero refers to the first
character of the string.

System.out.println(str.substring(4, str.length()));

Here the "case" substring is printed.

$ java Main.java
book
case

## Split string

The split method cuts a string into parts; it takes a delimiting
regular expression as a parameter.

Main.java
  

void main() {

    String s = "Today is a beautiful day.";
    String[] words = s.split(" ");

    for (String word : words) {

        System.out.println(word);
    }
}

The example splits a sentence into words.

String s = "Today is a beautiful day.";

This is a sentence to be split. The words are separated
by a space character.

String[] words = s.split(" ");

Using the split method, we cut the sentence
into words. The space character is used as a delimiter. The method
returns an array of strings.

for (String word : words) {

    System.out.println(word);
}

We go throught the array and print its content.

$ java Main.java
Today
is
a
beautiful
day.

## Removing string characters

When we split a string into words, some words have starting or ending characters
such as comma or dot. In the next example, we show how to remove such
characters.

Main.java
  

void main() {

    String str = "Did you go there? We did, but we had a \"great\" service there.";
    String[] parts = str.split(" ");

    for (String part: parts) {

        String word = removeChars(part);
        System.out.println(word);
    }
}

String removeChars(String part) {

    String word = part;

    if (part.endsWith(".") || part.endsWith("?") || part.endsWith(",")
            || part.endsWith("\"")) {
        word = part.substring(0, part.length()-1);
    }

    if (part.startsWith("\"")) {
        word = word.substring(1, part.length()-1);
    }

    return word;
}

The example split a string into words and removes potential commas, dots,
question marks, or double quotation marks.

String str = "Did you go there? We did, but we had a \"great\" service there.";

In this string, we have a question mark, a comma, quotation marks, and a dot attached
to the words.

String removeChars(String part) {
...
}

Inside this custom method, we remove those characters from our words.

if (part.endsWith(".") || part.endsWith("?") || part.endsWith(",")
    || part.endsWith("\"")) {
    word = part.substring(0, part.length()-1);
}

In this if statement, we remove the ending character. We use the
endsWith method to identify the characters that we want to remove.
The substring method returns a part of the string without the
character.

if (part.startsWith("\"")) {
    word = word.substring(1, part.length()-1);
}

Also, we remove the starting characters. The starting character is checked
with the startsWith method.

$ java Main.java
Did
you
go
there
We
did
but
we
had
a
great
service
there

## Joining strings

There is a join method to join strings. Refer to
[Java StringJoiner](/java/string-joiner/) to learn more about joining
strings in Java.

Main.java
  

void main() {

    String joined = String.join(" ", "Today", "is", "Sunday");
    System.out.println(joined);
}

In the example, we joing three strings into one final string.

String joined = String.join(" ", "Today", "is", "Sunday");

The first parameter of the join method is a delimiter that
is going to separater each string in the final string. The rest of the
parameters are strings to be joined.

## Comparing strings

There are two basic methods for comparing strings. The equals
method compares the contents of two strings and returns a boolean value
indicating, whether the strings are equal or not. The equalsIgnoreCase
does the same thing, except that it ignores the case.

Main.java
  

void main() {

    String a = "book";
    String b = "Book";

    System.out.println(a.equals(b));
    System.out.println(a.equalsIgnoreCase(b));
}

We compare two strings using the aforementioned methods.

String a = "book";
String b = "Book";

We define two strings that we compare.

System.out.println(a.equals(b));

The equals method returns false. The two strings differ
in the first character.

System.out.println(a.equalsIgnoreCase(b));

When we ignore the case, the strings are equal: the equalsIgnoreCase
method returns true.

$ java Main.java
false
true

If we are comparing a variable to a string, it is important to remember that the
string should be on the left side of the comparing method. Otherwise we might
get a NullPointerException.

Main.java
  

import java.util.Random;

String readString() {

    Random r = new Random();
    boolean b = r.nextBoolean();

    if (b == true) {

        return "ZetCode";
    } else {

        return null;
    }
}

void main() {

    String d = readString();

    if ("ZetCode".equals(d)) {

        System.out.println("Strings are equal");
    } else {

        System.out.println("Strings are not equal");
    }
}

In the code example, we compare the strings properly, avoiding a possible
NullPointerException.

String readString() {

    Random r = new Random();
    boolean b = r.nextBoolean();

    if (b == true) {

        return "ZetCode";
    } else {

        return null;
    }

The readString method simulates the case where a method invocation
can result in a null value. This could happen, for instance, if we try to read a
value from a database.

String d = readString();

The d variable can contain the null value.

if ("ZetCode".equals(d)) {

The above line is the correct way of comparing two strings where one string is a
known literal. If we placed the d variable on the left side, this would lead to
NullPointerException if the d variable would contain the null
value.

The equals method compares the characters of two strings. The
== operator tests for reference equality. All string literals are
interned automatically in Java. They are placed inside a string pool. This
happens at compile time. If two variables contain two equal string literals,
they in fact refer to the same string object inside a string pool.

Main.java
  

void main() {

    boolean a = "ZetCode" == "ZetCode";
    boolean b = "ZetCode" == new String("ZetCode");
    boolean c = "ZetCode" == "Zet" + "Code";
    boolean d = "ZetCode" == new String("ZetCode").intern();
    boolean e = "ZetCode" == " ZetCode ".trim();

    System.out.println(a);
    System.out.println(b);
    System.out.println(c);
    System.out.println(d);
    System.out.println(e);
}

In this code example, we compare string objects with the == operator.

boolean a = "ZetCode" == "ZetCode";

These strings literals are interned. Therefore, the identity comparison
operator returns true.

boolean b = "ZetCode" == new String("ZetCode");

Strings created with the new operator are not interned.
The comparison operator results in a false value.

boolean c = "ZetCode" == "Zet" + "Code";

Strings are concatenated at compile time. The string literals result in
the same object. The result is a true.

boolean d = "ZetCode" == new String("ZetCode").intern();

The intern object puts the string object on the right side into
the pool. Therefore, the d variable holds a boolean true.

boolean e = "ZetCode" == " ZetCode ".trim();

The trim method is called at runtime, generating a distinct
object. The e variable holds a boolean false.

$ java Main.java
true
false
true
true
false

## Format string

We have three basic methods to format a string in Java. Refer to 
[Java String format](/java/string-format/) for a more details.

Main.java
  

void main() {

    String name = "John Doe";
    String occupation = "gardener";

    String txt = "%s is a %s";
    String msg = txt.formatted(name, occupation);

    System.out.println(msg);

    System.out.format("%s is a %s\n", name, occupation);
    System.out.printf("%s is a %s%n", name, occupation);
}

We build the same string three times.

String name = "John Doe";
String occupation = "gardener";

String txt = "%s is a %s";
String msg = txt.formatted(name, occupation);

The formatted method is an instance method. The %s is 
a string format specifier, which is replaced with an actual value.

System.out.format("%s is a %s\n", name, occupation);
System.out.printf("%s is a %s%n", name, occupation);

The format and printf methods are static.

$ java Main.java
John Doe is a gardener
John Doe is a gardener
John Doe is a gardener
