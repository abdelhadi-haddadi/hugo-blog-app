# Ruby break Keyword

last modified April 27, 2025

This tutorial explains how to use Ruby's break keyword to control
loop execution. The break statement provides early termination of loops.

The break keyword immediately exits the current loop or iterator
block. Program execution continues with the statement following the loop.

Break is useful for stopping iteration when a condition is met or an error
occurs. It works with all loop types and enumerable methods in Ruby.

## Basic break in while Loop

This example shows break terminating a while loop when a counter reaches 5.
The loop would normally run 10 times but exits early.

basic_while_break.rb
  

counter = 0

while counter &lt; 10
  puts counter
  break if counter == 5
  counter += 1
end

puts "Loop ended"

The loop prints numbers 0 through 5, then breaks. Without break, it would
continue to 9. The message after the loop confirms normal termination.

## break in each Iterator

Break works similarly in iterators like each. This example searches an array
for a specific value and breaks when found.

array_search.rb
  

fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry', 'date', 'elderberry']

fruits.each do |fruit|
  puts "Checking #{fruit}"
  if fruit == 'date'
    puts "Found the date!"
    break
  end
end

puts "Search complete"

The loop checks each fruit until it finds 'date'. Break stops further iteration
unnecessarily checking 'elderberry'. The search completes immediately.

## break with Value

Ruby's break can return a value to the loop's context. This value becomes the
result of the loop expression.

break_with_value.rb
  

result = loop do
  num = rand(1..100)
  puts "Generated: #{num}"
  break num if num &gt; 90
end

puts "High number: #{result}"

The loop generates random numbers until one exceeds 90. Break returns this
number, which gets assigned to result. This pattern is useful for searches.

## Nested Loops with break

Break only exits the innermost loop. This example demonstrates breaking from
a nested loop structure.

nested_loops.rb
  

(1..3).each do |i|
  puts "Outer loop: #{i}"
  
  (1..3).each do |j|
    puts "  Inner loop: #{j}"
    break if j == 2
  end
end

The inner loop breaks when j reaches 2, but the outer loop continues. Each
outer iteration creates a new inner loop instance. Break affects only its
immediate containing loop.

## break in case Statement

While break is mainly for loops, it can appear in case statements within loops.
This example shows conditional breaking.

case_with_break.rb
  

count = 0

loop do
  count += 1
  case count
  when 1..3
    puts "Counting #{count}"
  when 4
    puts "Stopping at 4"
    break
  else
    break
  end
end

The case statement handles different count ranges. When count reaches 4, it
prints a message and breaks the loop. The else clause also breaks for safety.

## break vs return

Break exits loops, while return exits methods. This example contrasts their
behavior in similar contexts.

break_vs_return.rb
  

def test_break
  [1, 2, 3].each do |n|
    puts n
    break if n == 2
  end
  puts "After break"
end

def test_return
  [1, 2, 3].each do |n|
    puts n
    return if n == 2
  end
  puts "After return"
end

test_break
test_return

Break exits just the loop, so "After break" prints. Return exits the entire
method, skipping "After return". Choose based on desired scope of exit.

## break in Custom Methods

Methods using yield can respond to break from their blocks. This example shows
a custom method handling break appropriately.

custom_method.rb
  

def process_items
  items = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
  items.each do |item|
    yield(item)
  end
  :normal_exit
end

result = process_items do |n|
  puts "Processing #{n}"
  break :early_exit if n == 30
end

puts "Result: #{result}"

The block breaks when it hits 30, making the method return :early_exit. Without
break, it would return :normal_exit after processing all items.
