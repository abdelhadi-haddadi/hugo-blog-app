# ASP.NET Request

last modified April 3, 2025

In this article, we explore the Request object in ASP.NET 8. The Request object
provides access to incoming HTTP request data in ASP.NET applications.

ASP.NET is a cross-platform, high-performance framework for building modern web
applications. The Request object is essential for handling client input.

## Basic Definition

The Request object in ASP.NET represents the incoming HTTP request from a client.
It provides access to headers, query strings, form data, cookies, and more.

In ASP.NET Core, the Request object is available through the HttpContext.Request
property. It's part of the Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http namespace.

Request provides properties to access different parts of the HTTP request. These
include Path, Query, Headers, Cookies, Form, and Body. Each serves a specific
purpose in request processing.

## ASP.NET Request Example

The following example demonstrates various ways to use the Request object in
ASP.NET 8 to access different parts of an HTTP request.

Program.cs
  

var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);
builder.Services.AddControllers();

var app = builder.Build();

app.MapControllers();
app.Run();

This sets up a basic ASP.NET application with controller support. The
MapControllers method enables attribute routing for controllers.

Controllers/RequestDemoController.cs
  

using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;
using System.Text;

[ApiController]
[Route("api/[controller]")]
public class RequestDemoController : ControllerBase
{
    [HttpGet("headers")]
    public IActionResult GetHeaders()
    {
        var headers = Request.Headers
            .ToDictionary(h =&gt; h.Key, h =&gt; h.Value.ToString());
        return Ok(headers);
    }

    [HttpGet("query")]
    public IActionResult GetQueryParams()
    {
        var queryParams = Request.Query
            .ToDictionary(q =&gt; q.Key, q =&gt; q.Value.ToString());
        return Ok(queryParams);
    }

    [HttpGet("path/{id}")]
    public IActionResult GetPathParams(int id)
    {
        return Ok(new { 
            Id = id,
            Path = Request.Path,
            RouteValues = Request.RouteValues
        });
    }

    [HttpPost("form")]
    public async Task&lt;IActionResult&gt; ProcessForm()
    {
        if (!Request.HasFormContentType)
            return BadRequest("Expected form content");

        var form = await Request.ReadFormAsync();
        var formData = form.ToDictionary(f =&gt; f.Key, f =&gt; f.Value.ToString());
        return Ok(formData);
    }

    [HttpPost("body")]
    public async Task&lt;IActionResult&gt; ProcessBody()
    {
        using var reader = new StreamReader(
            Request.Body, Encoding.UTF8);
        var body = await reader.ReadToEndAsync();
        return Ok(new { BodyContent = body });
    }
}

This controller demonstrates five different ways to use the Request object. The
first method shows how to access HTTP headers through Request.Headers.

The second method accesses query string parameters using Request.Query.
The third method shows path parameters and route values from the request.

The fourth method demonstrates form data processing with ReadFormAsync.
The fifth method shows how to read the raw request body as a string.

Each method returns the extracted data in a structured format. The example shows
the versatility of the Request object in handling different request components.
