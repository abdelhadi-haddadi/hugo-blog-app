# Events in wxPython

last modified January 10, 2023

Events are integral part of every GUI application. All GUI applications are 
event-driven. An application reacts to different event types which are 
generated during its life. Events are generated mainly by the user of an 
application. But they can be generated by other means as well; e.g. Internet 
connection, window manager, or timer. So when we call MainLoop() method, our 
application waits for events to be generated. The MainLoop() method ends 
when we exit the application. 

## Definitions

*Event* is a piece of application-level information from the 
underlying framework, typically the GUI toolkit.
*Event loop* is  a programming construct that waits for and 
dispatches events or messages in a program. The event loop repeatedly 
looks for events to process. A *dispatcher* is a process which 
maps events to *event handlers*. Event handlers are methods 
that react to events.  

*Event object* is an object associated with the event. It is usually 
a window. *Event type* is a unique event that has been generated. 
*Event binder* is an object that binds an event type with an event handler.

## wxPython wx.EVT_MOVE example

In the following example we react to a wx.MoveEvent event.
The event is generated when we move a window to a new position. 
The event binder for this event is wx.EVT_MOVE.

import wx

class Example(wx.Frame):

    def __init__(self, *args, **kw):
        super(Example, self).__init__(*args, **kw)

        self.InitUI()

    def InitUI(self):

        wx.StaticText(self, label='x:', pos=(10,10))
        wx.StaticText(self, label='y:', pos=(10,30))

        self.st1 = wx.StaticText(self, label='', pos=(30, 10))
        self.st2 = wx.StaticText(self, label='', pos=(30, 30))

        self.Bind(wx.EVT_MOVE, self.OnMove)

        self.SetSize((350, 250))
        self.SetTitle('Move event')
        self.Centre()

    def OnMove(self, e):

        x, y = e.GetPosition()
        self.st1.SetLabel(str(x))
        self.st2.SetLabel(str(y))

def main():

    app = wx.App()
    ex = Example(None)
    ex.Show()
    app.MainLoop()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main() 

The example displays the current position of the window.

self.Bind(wx.EVT_MOVE, self.OnMove)

Here we bind the wx.EVT_MOVE event binder to the 
OnMove() method.

def OnMove(self, e):
    
    x, y = e.GetPosition()
    self.st1.SetLabel(str(x))
    self.st2.SetLabel(str(y))

The event parameter in the OnMove() method is an object specific 
to a particular event type. In our case it is the instance of a wx.MoveEvent 
class. This object holds information about the event. For example the event 
object or the position of the window. In our case the event object is the 
wx.Frame widget. We can find out the current position by calling the 
GetPosition() method of the event.

![moveevent.png](images/moveevent.png)

## wxPython event binding

The three steps to work with events in wxPython are:

- Identify the event binder name: wx.EVT_SIZE, wx.EVT_CLOSE etc.
 
- Create an event handler. This method  is called when an event is generated.
 
- Bind an event to an event handler.
 

In wxPython we say to bind a method to an event. 
Sometimes a word hook is used. You bind an event by calling 
the Bind() method. The method has the following parameters: 

Bind(event, handler, source=None, id=wx.ID_ANY, id2=wx.ID_ANY)

The event is one of EVT_* objects. It specifies the type of the event.
The handler is an object to be called. In other words, it is a method 
that a programmer binds to an event. The source parameter is used when 
we want to differentiate between the same event type from different widgets. 
The id parameter is used when we have multiple buttons, menu items etc. 
The id is used to differentiate among them. The id2 is used 
when it is desirable to bind a handler to a range of ids, such as with 
EVT_MENU_RANGE.

Note that method Bind() is defined in class EvtHandler. 
It is a class from which wx.Window inherits. wx.Window is 
a base class for most widgets in wxPython. There is also a reverse process. If we want 
to unbind a method from an event, we call the Unbind() method. It has the 
same parameters as the above one.

## Vetoing events

Sometimes we need to stop processing an event. To do this, we call 
the method Veto().

event_veto.py
  

#!/usr/bin/env python

import wx

"""
ZetCode wxPython tutorial

In this example we veto an event.

class Example(wx.Frame):

    def __init__(self, *args, **kw):
        super(Example, self).__init__(*args, **kw)

        self.InitUI()

    def InitUI(self):

        self.Bind(wx.EVT_CLOSE, self.OnCloseWindow)

        self.SetTitle('Event veto')
        self.Centre()

    def OnCloseWindow(self, e):

        dial = wx.MessageDialog(None, 'Are you sure to quit?', 'Question',
            wx.YES_NO | wx.NO_DEFAULT | wx.ICON_QUESTION)

        ret = dial.ShowModal()

        if ret == wx.ID_YES:
            self.Destroy()
        else:
            e.Veto()

def main():

    app = wx.App()
    ex = Example(None)
    ex.Show()
    app.MainLoop()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()

In our example, we process a wx.CloseEvent. This event is called, 
when we click the X button on the titlebar, press Alt+F4 
or select close from the system menu. In many applications, we want to prevent 
from accidentally closing the window if we made some changes. To do this, we 
must bind the wx.EVT_CLOSE event binder.

dial = wx.MessageDialog(None, 'Are you sure to quit?', 'Question',
    wx.YES_NO | wx.NO_DEFAULT | wx.ICON_QUESTION)
    
ret = dial.ShowModal()

During the processing of the close event we show a message dialog. 

if ret == wx.ID_YES:
    self.Destroy()
else:
    event.Veto()

Depending on the return value from the dialog, we destroy the window, or veto the event. 
Notice that to close the window, we must call the Destroy() method. 
By calling the Close() method, we would end up in an endless cycle.

## wxPython event propagation

There are two types of events: basic events and command events. They differ 
in propagation. Event propagation is travelling of events from child widgets 
to parent widgets and grand parent widgets. Basic events do not propagate. 
Command events do propagate. For example wx.CloseEvent is a basic event. 
It does not make sense for this event to propagate to parent widgets. 

By default, the event that is caught in a event handler stops propagating. 
To continue propagation, we call the Skip() method.

event_propagation.py
  

#!/usr/bin/env python

This example demonstrates event propagation.

    main()

In our example, we have a button on a panel. The panel is placed in a 
frame widget. We define a handler for all widgets. 

def OnButtonClicked(self, e):

    print('event reached button class')
    e.Skip()

We process the button click event in our custom button class. 
The Skip() method propagates the event further to
to panel class. 

Try to omit some Skip() methods and see what hapens.

## Window identifiers

Window identifiers are integers that uniquely determine the window 
identity in the event system. There are three ways to create window ids.

    - let the system automatically create an id

    - use standard identifiers

    - create your own id

wx.Button(parent, -1)
wx.Button(parent, wx.ID_ANY)

If we provide -1 or wx.ID_ANY for the id parameter, we let the wxPython 
automatically create an id for us. The automatically created id's are
always negative, whereas user specified ids must always be positive.
We usually use this option when we do not need to change the widget state. 
For example a static text that will never be changed during the life of the 
application. We can still get the id if we want. There is a method GetId()
which determines the id.

default_ids.py
  

#!/usr/bin/env python

In this example, we do not care about the actual id value. 

self.Bind(wx.EVT_BUTTON,  self.OnExit, id=exitButton.GetId())

We get the automatically generated id by calling the GetId() method.

It is recommended to use standard identifiers. The identifiers can 
provide some standard graphics or behaviour on some platforms. 

## wxPython standard ids

wxPython contains some standard ids such as wx.ID_SAVE or 
wx.ID_NEW.

In our example we use standard identifiers on buttons. On Linux, the buttons 
have icons.

grid.AddMany([(wx.Button(pnl, wx.ID_CANCEL), 0, wx.TOP | wx.LEFT, 9),
    (wx.Button(pnl, wx.ID_DELETE), 0, wx.TOP, 9),

    (wx.Button(pnl, wx.ID_STOP), 0, wx.LEFT, 9),
    (wx.Button(pnl, wx.ID_NEW))])

We add six buttons to a grid sizer. The wx.ID_CANCEL, wx.ID_DELETE, 
wx.ID_SAVE, wx.ID_EXIT, wx.ID_STOP, and 
wx.ID_NEW are standard identifiers. 

self.Bind(wx.EVT_BUTTON, self.OnQuitApp, id=wx.ID_EXIT)

We bind the button click event to the OnQuitApp() event handler. The
id parameter is used to differantiate among the buttons. We uniquely
identify the source of the event.

for this menu items are created globally.

ID_MENU_NEW = wx.NewId()
ID_MENU_OPEN = wx.NewId()
ID_MENU_SAVE = wx.NewId()

The wx.NewId() method creates a new unique id. 

self.Bind(wx.EVT_MENU, self.DisplayMessage, id=ID_MENU_NEW)
self.Bind(wx.EVT_MENU, self.DisplayMessage, id=ID_MENU_OPEN)
self.Bind(wx.EVT_MENU, self.DisplayMessage, id=ID_MENU_SAVE) 

All three menu items are identified by their unique id. 

eid = e.GetId()

if eid == ID_MENU_NEW:
    msg = 'New menu item selected'
elif eid == ID_MENU_OPEN:
    msg = 'Open menu item selected'
elif eid == ID_MENU_SAVE:
    msg = 'Save menu item selected'

From the event object we retrieve the id. Depending on the
id value, we prepare the message, which is displayed in the
statusbar of the application. 

## wx.PaintEvent

A paint event is generated when a window is redrawn. This happens when 
we resize a window or when we maximize it. A paint event can be generated 
programatically as well. For example, when we call SetLabel() method 
to change a wx.StaticText widget. Note that when we minimize 
a window, no paint event is generated.

the number of paint events on the window with DrawText() method.

## wx.FocusEvent

A focus indicates the currently selected widget in application. 
The text entered from the keyboard or pasted from the clipboard is 
sent to the widget, which has the focus. There are two event types 
concerning focus. The wx.EVT_SET_FOCUS
event, which is generated when a widget receives focus. The 
wx.EVT_KILL_FOCUS is generated, when the widget looses focus.

the outline depends on whether the window has focus or not. 
The outline of the focused window is drawn in red colour. 

def OnSetFocus(self, e):

    self.color = '#ff0000'
    self.Refresh()

In the OnSetFocus() method, we set the self.color variable
to red colour. We refresh the frame window which will generate
a paint event for all its child widgets. The windows are redrawn and
the one with the focus has a new colour for its outline. 

def OnKillFocus(self, e):

    self.color = '#b3b3b3'

The OnKillFocus() method is called when the window looses focus.
We change the colour value and refresh.

        pnl.Bind(wx.EVT_KEY_DOWN, self.OnKeyDown)
        pnl.SetFocus()

        self.SetSize((350, 250))
        self.SetTitle('Key event')
        self.Centre()

    def OnKeyDown(self, e):

        key = e.GetKeyCode()

        if key == wx.WXK_ESCAPE:

            ret  = wx.MessageBox('Are you sure to quit?', 'Question',
                wx.YES_NO | wx.NO_DEFAULT, self)

            if ret == wx.YES:
                self.Close()

def main():

    app = wx.App()
    ex = Example(None)
    ex.Show()
    app.MainLoop()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()

In this example, we process the Esc key press. A message box is shown 
to confirm the termination of the application.

pnl.Bind(wx.EVT_KEY_DOWN, self.OnKeyDown)

We bind an event handler to the wx.EVT_KEY_DOWN event. 

key = e.GetKeyCode()

Here we get the key code of the pressed key.

if key == wx.WXK_ESCAPE:

We check the key code. The Esc key has wx.WXK_ESCAPE code.

In this chapter, we talked about events in wxPython.
