# PHP readlink Function

last modified April 3, 2025

The PHP readlink function returns the target of a symbolic link.
It's essential for working with symlinks in filesystem operations.

## Basic Definition

The readlink function returns the target path of a symbolic link.
It takes one parameter: the path to the symbolic link.

Syntax: readlink(string $path): string|false. The function returns
the target path or false on failure. It only works on symbolic links.

## Basic readlink Example

This shows the simplest usage of readlink to get a symlink target.

basic_readlink.php
  

&lt;?php

declare(strict_types=1);

$linkPath = "/var/www/html/link-to-config";
$target = readlink($linkPath);

if ($target !== false) {
    echo "Symlink points to: " . $target;
} else {
    echo "Failed to read symlink or not a symlink";
}

This reads the target of a symbolic link. Always check the return value as it
may fail if the path isn't a symlink or doesn't exist.

## Relative Path Resolution

readlink may return relative paths that need resolution.

relative_path.php
  

&lt;?php

declare(strict_types=1);

$linkPath = "data/link-to-docs";
$target = readlink($linkPath);

if ($target !== false) {
    $absolutePath = realpath(dirname($linkPath) . '/' . $target;
    echo "Absolute path: " . $absolutePath;
} else {
    echo "Failed to read symlink";
}

This example shows how to resolve relative symlink targets to absolute paths.
The realpath function helps get the canonicalized absolute path.

## Checking Before Reading

It's good practice to verify a path is a symlink before reading it.

check_before_read.php
  

&lt;?php

declare(strict_types=1);

$path = "/usr/bin/php";

if (is_link($path)) {
    $target = readlink($path);
    echo "Symlink target: " . $target;
} else {
    echo "Path is not a symbolic link";
}

Here we use is_link to check if the path is a symlink before
attempting to read it. This prevents errors when dealing with regular files.

## Error Handling

Proper error handling is important when working with filesystem functions.

error_handling.php
  

&lt;?php

declare(strict_types=1);

$linkPath = "/tmp/nonexistent-link";

try {
    $target = readlink($linkPath);
    
    if ($target === false) {
        throw new RuntimeException("Failed to read symlink");
    }
    
    echo "Symlink target: " . $target;
} catch (Throwable $e) {
    echo "Error: " . $e-&gt;getMessage();
}

This demonstrates robust error handling for symlink operations. The try-catch
block captures any filesystem-related exceptions that might occur.

## Recursive Symlink Resolution

This example shows how to resolve symlinks that point to other symlinks.

recursive_resolve.php
  

&lt;?php

declare(strict_types=1);

function resolveSymlink(string $path, int $maxDepth = 10): string {
    if ($maxDepth &lt;= 0) {
        throw new RuntimeException("Maximum symlink depth exceeded");
    }
    
    if (!is_link($path)) {
        return $path;
    }
    
    $target = readlink($path);
    if ($target === false) {
        throw new RuntimeException("Failed to read symlink");
    }
    
    if (str_starts_with($target, '/')) {
        return resolveSymlink($target, $maxDepth - 1);
    }
    
    $dir = dirname($path);
    return resolveSymlink($dir . '/' . $target, $maxDepth - 1);
}

$finalPath = resolveSymlink('/var/www/html/link-to-app');
echo "Final path: " . $finalPath;

This recursive function resolves symlinks until it reaches a regular file or
directory. It includes safety checks for maximum recursion depth and relative
path resolution.

## Best Practices

- **Check First:** Verify paths exist and are symlinks before reading.

- **Handle Errors:** Always check the return value for false.

- **Path Resolution:** Be prepared to handle relative paths.

- **Security:** Validate symlink targets before using them.

- **Recursion:** Handle symlink chains carefully to avoid loops.
