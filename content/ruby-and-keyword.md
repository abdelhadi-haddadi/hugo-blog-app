# Ruby and Keyword

last modified April 27, 2025

This tutorial explains how to use Ruby's and keyword. It serves
as both a logical operator and a control flow tool in Ruby programs.

The and keyword evaluates multiple expressions, returning the first
falsey value or the last truthy value. It has lower precedence than &amp;&amp;.

Unlike &amp;&amp;, and is useful for control flow rather than
boolean logic. It's commonly used for chaining operations where any failure
should stop execution.

## Basic and Operator

This example shows the basic boolean operation with and. It returns
true only when both operands are truthy.

basic_and.rb
  

result = true and false
puts result  # =&gt; false

result = 1 and "hello"
puts result  # =&gt; "hello"

result = nil and 5
puts result.inspect  # =&gt; nil

The and operator evaluates expressions left-to-right. It returns
the first falsey value or the last value if all are truthy.

## and vs &amp;&amp; Precedence

The key difference between and and &amp;&amp; is precedence.
and has much lower precedence, which affects evaluation order.

precedence.rb
  

x = true &amp;&amp; false
puts x  # =&gt; false

y = true and false
puts y  # =&gt; true

The first example assigns the result of &amp;&amp; to x. The
second assigns true to y then evaluates and false.
This demonstrates and's lower precedence.

## Control Flow with and

and is often used for control flow where operations should continue
only if previous ones succeed. This example shows a common pattern.

control_flow.rb
  

def fetch_data
  # Simulate possible failure
  rand &gt; 0.5 ? "data" : nil
end

data = fetch_data and process_data(data)

puts "Data processed successfully" if data

def process_data(data)
  puts "Processing: #{data}"
end

The process_data method only runs if fetch_data
returns truthy. This provides concise conditional execution.

## Multiple Conditions with and

and can chain multiple conditions together. Evaluation stops at the
first falsey value due to short-circuit behavior.

multiple_conditions.rb
  

def valid_user?(user)
  user[:name] and user[:email] and user[:active]
end

user1 = { name: "John", email: "john@example.com", active: true }
user2 = { name: "Alice", email: nil, active: true }

puts valid_user?(user1)  # =&gt; true
puts valid_user?(user2)  # =&gt; false

The method checks all required user attributes. It returns false
immediately if any check fails, making it efficient.

## and for Assignment Guarding

and can prevent assignment when a condition fails. This pattern
helps avoid overwriting variables with nil values.

assignment_guard.rb
  

def get_config_value
  # Simulate config lookup that might fail
  rand &gt; 0.3 ? "admin" : nil
end

# Only assign if get_config_value returns truthy
role = get_config_value and role = role.upcase

puts role.inspect

The variable role only gets assigned and modified if
get_config_value returns a truthy value. This prevents nil errors.

## and in Modifier Position

and can be used in statement modifier position to conditionally
execute code. This provides a concise alternative to if.

modifier_position.rb
  

def log_in(user)
  puts "Logging in #{user[:name]}"
  user[:authenticated] = true
end

current_user = { name: "John", password: "secret" }

authenticate(current_user) and log_in(current_user)

def authenticate(user)
  user[:password] == "secret"
end

The log_in method only executes if authenticate
returns true. This pattern is common in authentication flows.

## Error Handling with and

and can chain operations with error handling. Each step executes
only if the previous one succeeds.

error_handling.rb
  

def read_file(path)
  File.exist?(path) and File.read(path)
end

def parse_json(data)
  JSON.parse(data) rescue nil
end

data = read_file("config.json") and config = parse_json(data)

puts config ? "Config loaded" : "Failed to load config"

The example safely attempts to read and parse a file. Each operation proceeds
only if the previous one succeeds, avoiding nested conditionals.
