# PHP realpath_cache_get Function

last modified April 3, 2025

The PHP realpath_cache_get function retrieves the current realpath
cache entries. It helps understand how PHP caches resolved file paths.

## Basic Definition

The realpath_cache_get function returns an array of cached realpath
entries. PHP uses this cache to store resolved paths for better performance.

Syntax: realpath_cache_get(): array. The function takes no
parameters and returns an associative array with cache entries.

## Basic realpath_cache_get Example

This shows the simplest usage of realpath_cache_get to view cache.

basic_realpath_cache.php
  

&lt;?php

declare(strict_types=1);

// Access a file to populate the cache
$path = realpath(__FILE__);

// Get the cache contents
$cache = realpath_cache_get();

print_r($cache);

This outputs the realpath cache after resolving the current file's path. The
cache contains detailed information about resolved paths.

## Cache Entry Structure

Each cache entry contains several fields with information about the path.

cache_structure.php
  

&lt;?php

declare(strict_types=1);

// Access a file to populate the cache
$path = realpath(__DIR__ . '/../config.ini');

// Get and examine a cache entry
$cache = realpath_cache_get();
$entry = current($cache);

echo "Key: " . key($cache) . "\n";
echo "Resolved path: " . $entry['realpath'] . "\n";
echo "Expire time: " . $entry['expires'] . "\n";
echo "Is directory: " . ($entry['is_dir'] ? 'Yes' : 'No') . "\n";

This shows the structure of a cache entry. Each entry includes the resolved
path, expiration time, and whether it's a directory.

## Monitoring Cache Size

You can check how many entries are in the realpath cache.

cache_size.php
  

&lt;?php

declare(strict_types=1);

// Access several files to populate cache
realpath(__FILE__);
realpath(__DIR__);
realpath('/tmp');

// Get cache information
$cache = realpath_cache_get();

echo "Cache contains " . count($cache) . " entries\n";
echo "Memory usage: " . memory_get_usage(true) . " bytes\n";

This demonstrates checking the cache size and memory impact. The cache grows
as more paths are resolved during script execution.

## Cache Expiration

Cache entries have expiration times based on the realpath_cache_ttl setting.

cache_expiration.php
  

&lt;?php

declare(strict_types=1);

// Get current time
$now = time();

// Access a file
$path = realpath(__FILE__);

// Check cache expiration
$cache = realpath_cache_get();
$entry = current($cache);

$remaining = $entry['expires'] - $now;
echo "Cache entry expires in $remaining seconds\n";

This calculates how long until a cache entry expires. The default TTL is
typically 120 seconds but can be changed in php.ini.

## Comparing Cached and Uncached Performance

The cache significantly improves performance for repeated path resolutions.

performance_comparison.php
  

&lt;?php

declare(strict_types=1);

function timeResolution(string $path): float {
    $start = microtime(true);
    realpath($path);
    return microtime(true) - $start;
}

$path = __FILE__;

// First resolution (uncached)
$uncachedTime = timeResolution($path);

// Second resolution (cached)
$cachedTime = timeResolution($path);

echo "Uncached: " . $uncachedTime . " seconds\n";
echo "Cached: " . $cachedTime . " seconds\n";
echo "Improvement: " . ($uncachedTime/$cachedTime) . "x faster\n";

This compares the performance of cached vs uncached path resolutions. The
realpath cache can make repeated operations significantly faster.

## Best Practices

- **Monitor Size:** Watch cache size in long-running scripts.

- **TTL Settings:** Adjust realpath_cache_ttl as needed.

- **Debugging:** Use to debug path resolution issues.

- **Performance:** Understand its impact on filesystem ops.
