## GTK#

GTK# is a wrapper over the GTK+ for the C# programming language. 
The library facilitates building graphical GNOME applications using Mono 
or any other compliant CLR. Applications built using Gtk# will run on many 
platforms including Linux, Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X. GTK# is part 
of the Mono initiative.
