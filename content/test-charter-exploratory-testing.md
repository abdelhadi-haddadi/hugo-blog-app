# Test Charter (Exploratory Testing)

last modified April 4, 2025

## Definition of Test Charter

A test charter is a focused mission statement that guides exploratory testing
sessions by defining what to test and how to approach it. It serves as a
lightweight planning document that outlines the scope, objectives, and focus
areas for a testing session without prescribing exact steps. Test charters
balance structure with flexibility, allowing testers to investigate the software
creatively while maintaining clear goals. They typically include the purpose of
testing, areas to cover, potential risks to consider, and any special
conditions or constraints. Unlike scripted test cases, charters encourage
adaptive thinking and real-time learning during the testing process.

The concept originates from session-based test management (SBTM), a structured
approach to exploratory testing. Charters help organize exploratory efforts into
manageable time-boxed sessions, usually 60-120 minutes long. They provide just
enough direction to keep testing purposeful while leaving room for serendipitous
discovery. Effective charters are concise yet informative, acting as a compass
rather than a map for the testing journey.

## Broader Context of Test Charters

Test charters exist within the broader framework of exploratory testing, an
approach that emphasizes learning, test design, and execution simultaneously.
Unlike traditional scripted testing, exploratory testing treats test design as an
ongoing activity performed in parallel with test execution. Charters provide the
necessary structure to make this fluid approach manageable in professional
settings. They bridge the gap between completely ad-hoc testing and rigidly
scripted approaches, offering a middle ground that combines focus with
flexibility.

In Agile and DevOps environments, test charters have gained prominence as they
align well with iterative development and rapid feedback cycles. They complement
automated regression suites by focusing on areas where human intuition and
creativity add the most value. Charters also facilitate collaboration by
providing a shared understanding of testing goals among team members. When used
in conjunction with other testing techniques, they help create a comprehensive
quality strategy that balances predictability with adaptability.

## Characteristics of Test Charters

**Goal-oriented** - Clearly states the purpose and objectives of
the testing session.
**Time-boxed** - Designed for completion within a specific
duration, typically 60-120 minutes.
**Flexible yet focused** - Provides direction without
over-constraining the tester's approach.
**Risk-aware** - Often includes considerations of potential
failure areas or quality risks.
**Concise** - Usually one or two sentences that capture the
essence of the testing mission.
**Collaborative** - Often created through team discussions to
leverage diverse perspectives.

## Components of a Test Charter

While test charters vary in format, most effective ones contain several key
components that provide structure to the exploratory session. These elements
work together to guide the tester while allowing for creative investigation. The
charter should be brief enough to remain flexible but detailed enough to provide
meaningful direction. Below we outline the typical components found in
well-constructed test charters, along with their purposes and examples.

Understanding these components helps testers create charters that strike the
right balance between freedom and focus. Whether working individually or in
teams, these elements ensure exploratory testing remains productive and aligned
with project goals while still allowing for serendipitous discovery of important
issues.

Component
Description
Example

Purpose
The primary objective or question the session aims to address
"Determine how the checkout process handles inventory changes"

Scope
The features, components or areas to focus on during testing
"Payment gateway integration and order confirmation emails"

Approach
Suggested techniques, heuristics or testing strategies to employ
"Use boundary analysis on quantity field, simulate network failures"

Risks
Potential problem areas or quality concerns to investigate
"Verify data consistency between cart and inventory systems"

Constraints
Any limitations or special conditions for the session
"Test only on mobile devices, ignore accessibility for this session"

## Benefits of Using Test Charters

Test charters offer numerous advantages that make them valuable in modern
software testing approaches. They provide structure to exploratory testing
without stifling creativity, helping testers stay focused while allowing room
for investigation. By defining clear objectives, charters ensure testing efforts
align with project priorities and risk areas. This targeted approach often leads
to more efficient discovery of important defects compared to completely ad-hoc
exploration.

Additionally, test charters facilitate better communication and collaboration
within testing teams. They serve as lightweight documentation that can be easily
shared and discussed among team members. Charters also enable more accurate
tracking of testing coverage and effort, addressing common challenges with
exploratory testing metrics. When used consistently, they help create a
repeatable yet adaptable testing process that balances systematic investigation
with creative problem-solving.

## Implementation Best Practices

- **Keep charters focused** - Limit each charter to a specific area or question to maintain clarity.

- **Time-box sessions** - Set clear time limits (typically 60-120 mins) to maintain energy and focus.

- **Balance structure and freedom** - Provide enough direction without over-specifying test steps.

- **Prioritize based on risk** - Create charters that target the highest risk areas first.

- **Review and refine** - Continuously improve charters based on feedback and results.

- **Combine with debriefs** - Follow each session with a short discussion of findings and insights.
