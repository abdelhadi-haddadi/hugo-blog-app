# Sanity Testing

last modified April 4, 2025

## Definition of Sanity Testing

Sanity testing is a focused software testing method that verifies specific
functionality after code changes. It ensures that recent modifications or bug
fixes work as intended without breaking existing features. Unlike comprehensive
testing approaches, sanity testing is narrow in scope, targeting only the
affected areas of the application. This type of testing is typically performed
after receiving a software build with minor changes to confirm rationality. It
acts as a checkpoint to determine if the build is stable enough for further
testing.

The term "sanity" refers to checking the logical correctness of specific
functionality. It's often confused with smoke testing but differs in scope and
purpose. While smoke testing evaluates the entire system's basic functionality,
sanity testing focuses on particular components or fixes. It's a quick,
surface-level validation performed when full regression testing isn't necessary.
This makes it an efficient tool for rapid development cycles where time is
limited.

## Broader Context of Sanity Testing

Sanity testing plays a crucial role in agile development environments and
continuous integration pipelines. It fits between smoke testing and regression
testing in the QA process hierarchy. After a build passes initial smoke tests,
sanity tests verify that specific changes haven't introduced new defects. This
targeted approach saves time and resources by avoiding unnecessary full test
cycles for minor updates. In DevOps workflows, sanity tests often run
automatically after deployments to production-like environments.

The practice supports iterative development by providing quick feedback on code
changes. It's particularly valuable when multiple teams work on different
application components simultaneously. Sanity testing helps maintain system
stability despite frequent updates. It also reduces regression testing overhead
by catching issues early in the development cycle. When integrated with CI/CD,
it becomes a gatekeeper ensuring only properly functioning changes progress.

## Characteristics of Sanity Testing

**Narrow in scope** - Focuses only on specific functionalities
or recently changed areas of the application.
**Quick execution** - Designed to be completed rapidly, often
in minutes rather than hours.
**Performed after smoke testing** - Conducted only when the
build has passed initial stability checks.
**Non-exhaustive by nature** - Doesn't cover all possible test
cases, just critical paths related to changes.
**Often manual but can be automated** - Frequently performed
manually for ad-hoc validation but can be scripted for repetitive checks.
**Documentation-light** - Typically doesn't require extensive
test case documentation like formal testing phases.

## Types of Sanity Testing

Sanity testing can be categorized based on execution method and integration with
development workflows. The approach varies depending on project requirements,
team structure, and the nature of changes being validated. While the core
purpose remains consistent—verifying specific functionality—the implementation
details differ across these types. Understanding these variations helps teams
select the most appropriate method for their context.

The choice between manual and automated sanity testing often depends on the
frequency of changes and available resources. Similarly, the distinction between
feature-specific and build-specific sanity testing determines the test coverage.
Below we outline the primary types of sanity testing with their characteristics
and typical use cases.

Type
Description

Manual Sanity Testing
Performed by QA engineers executing targeted test cases without automation.
Ideal for one-off changes or when test scenarios are unpredictable.

Automated Sanity Testing
Uses scripts to validate specific functionality automatically. Best for
frequently changed areas where tests can be reliably predefined.

Feature-Specific Sanity Testing
Focuses exclusively on new or modified features to confirm they work as
designed without affecting unrelated components.

Build-Specific Sanity Testing
Validates that a particular build containing specific fixes functions
correctly, often performed before release candidates.

## Benefits of Sanity Testing

Sanity testing offers significant advantages in software quality assurance,
particularly in fast-paced development environments. It provides rapid feedback
on code changes, allowing developers to verify fixes immediately. This quick
validation cycle accelerates development while maintaining quality standards. By
focusing only on affected areas, it reduces testing overhead compared to full
regression suites. This efficiency makes it ideal for projects with frequent,
small updates.

Another key benefit is defect early detection in modified functionality. Sanity
testing catches issues before they reach later testing stages or production. It
serves as a cost-effective quality gate, preventing minor changes from
introducing major problems. The practice also improves team productivity by
reducing unnecessary test execution. When integrated properly, sanity testing
maintains software stability without sacrificing development speed.

## Implementation Best Practices

- **Define clear scope for each test** - Specify exactly what functionality will be validated to maintain focus.

- **Prioritize based on risk and impact** - Test areas most likely to break or cause significant user disruption first.

- **Maintain a library of reusable test cases** - Create modular tests for frequently modified components.

- **Balance manual and automated approaches** - Automate repetitive checks but keep flexibility for exploratory testing.

- **Integrate with development workflows** - Run sanity tests as part of code review or pre-commit processes when possible.

- **Document findings concisely** - Record test results and observations without excessive bureaucracy.
