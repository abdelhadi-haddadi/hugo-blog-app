The MySQL database chapter presents MySQL and its mysql

basic work with MySQL. The JDBC chapter covers MySQL Java programming 
using JDBC, which is the basic API for database programming in Java. 
In the Data source and connection pooling chapter, we show how to set up a data source 
in a command line and a web Java application. 

The JDBI chapter covers JDBI interface, which is a low-level abstraction 
of the basic JDBC. The Spring JdbcTemplate chapter covers JdbcTemplate, 
which is Spring's template library for dealing with the complexities 
of JDBC programming. The MyBatis persistence framework chapter covers the low-level 
MyBatis persistence framework. Finally, the EclipseLink
chapter is an introductory chapter to EclipseLink, 
a high-level ORM framework.
