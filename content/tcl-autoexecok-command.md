# Tcl auto_execok Command

last modified April 3, 2025

The Tcl auto_execok command determines if an executable program
exists in the system's PATH. It's commonly used before executing external
programs to verify their availability.

## Basic Definition

The auto_execok command checks if a given executable name exists
in the system's PATH. It returns the full path to the executable if found.

Syntax: auto_execok name. If the executable is found, it returns
its full path. If not found, it returns an empty string.

## Checking for Common Utilities

This example demonstrates checking for common system utilities like 'ls' on Unix
or 'dir' on Windows.

basic_check.tcl
  

set ls_path [auto_execok ls]
if {$ls_path ne ""} {
    puts "ls found at: $ls_path"
} else {
    puts "ls not found in PATH"
}

This checks if the 'ls' command exists in the system PATH. The result is stored
in ls_path and then checked for emptiness to determine existence.

## Platform-Specific Executable Checking

auto_execok handles platform differences automatically, making it
useful for cross-platform scripts.

platform_check.tcl
  

set cmd [expr {$::tcl_platform(platform) eq "windows" ? "dir" : "ls"}]
set cmd_path [auto_execok $cmd]
puts "Command path: $cmd_path"

This example selects the appropriate command based on platform and checks its
availability. On Windows it checks for 'dir', on Unix for 'ls'.

## Checking Multiple Executables

You can check multiple potential executables to find which one is available.

multi_check.tcl
  

foreach editor {vim nano gedit notepad} {
    set path [auto_execok $editor]
    if {$path ne ""} {
        puts "Found editor: $path"
        break
    }
}

This checks for several common text editors in order. The first one found in
PATH will be reported, demonstrating a fallback strategy for executables.

## Using with exec

auto_execok is often used before calling exec to
avoid errors from missing executables.

exec_check.tcl
  

set git_path [auto_execok git]
if {$git_path ne ""} {
    set version [exec git --version]
    puts "Git version: $version"
} else {
    puts "Git not installed"
}

This safely checks for Git before attempting to execute it. This prevents
runtime errors if Git isn't installed on the system.

## Checking with Arguments

auto_execok can check commands that might include arguments.

args_check.tcl
  

set python_cmd [auto_execok python3]
if {$python_cmd eq ""} {
    set python_cmd [auto_execok python]
}
puts "Python command: $python_cmd"

This checks for Python 3 first, then falls back to regular Python. It
demonstrates how to handle version-specific executable names.

## Advanced Path Handling

For complex cases, you might need to handle PATH environment variable directly.

path_handling.tcl
  

set orig_path $::env(PATH)
set ::env(PATH) "$orig_path:/custom/path"
set custom_tool [auto_execok mytool]
set ::env(PATH) $orig_path
puts "Custom tool path: $custom_tool"

This temporarily modifies PATH to include a custom directory, checks for an
executable, then restores the original PATH. Useful for non-standard locations.

## Best Practices

- **Error Handling:** Always check the return value.

- **Platform Awareness:** Account for OS differences.

- **PATH Modification:** Restore PATH after temporary changes.

- **Fallbacks:** Provide alternative commands when possible.

- **Caching:** Cache results if checking repeatedly.
