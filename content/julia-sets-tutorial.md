# Julia Sets Tutorial

last modified March 3, 2025

In Julia, a **set** is an unordered collection of unique elements. 
Sets are useful for operations like union, intersection, and difference. 
This tutorial covers basic definitions and practical examples of using sets in Julia.

## Basic Definitions

A set in Julia is created using the Set() function. 
Sets do not allow duplicate elements, and the order of elements is not preserved.

main.jl
  

s = Set([1, 2, 3, 4])

This creates a set s with elements 1, 2, 3, and 4.

## Creating a Set

This example demonstrates how to create a set in Julia.

main.jl
  

s = Set([1, 2, 3, 4])
println(s)

Output: Set([4, 2, 3, 1])

## Adding Elements

This example shows how to add elements to a set.

main.jl
  

push!(s, 5)
println(s)

Output: Set([4, 2, 3, 1, 5])

## Removing Elements

This example demonstrates how to remove elements from a set.

main.jl
  

pop!(s, 3)
println(s)

Output: Set([4, 2, 1, 5])

## Checking Membership

This example shows how to check if an element is in a set.

main.jl
  

println(2 in s)

Output: true

## Union of Sets

This example demonstrates how to find the union of two sets.

main.jl
  

s1 = Set([1, 2, 3])
s2 = Set([3, 4, 5])
println(union(s1, s2))

Output: Set([4, 2, 3, 1, 5])

## Intersection of Sets

This example shows how to find the intersection of two sets.

main.jl
  

println(intersect(s1, s2))

Output: Set([3])

## Difference of Sets

This example demonstrates how to find the difference between two sets.

main.jl
  

println(setdiff(s1, s2))

Output: Set([1, 2])

## Symmetric Difference

This example shows how to find the symmetric difference of two sets.

main.jl
  

println(symdiff(s1, s2))

Output: Set([4, 2, 1, 5])

## Subset Check

This example demonstrates how to check if one set is a subset of another.

main.jl
  

println(issubset(Set([1, 2]), s1))

Output: true

##  Set Size

This example shows how to find the number of elements in a set.

main.jl
  

println(length(s1))

Output: 3

## Best Practices for Sets

- **Use for Unique Elements:** Use sets when you need to store unique elements.

- **Efficient Membership Checks:** Sets provide O(1) average time complexity for membership checks.

- **Combine with Other Data Structures:** Use sets with arrays or dictionaries for complex operations.

- **Immutable Sets:** Consider using ImmutableSet for fixed collections.
