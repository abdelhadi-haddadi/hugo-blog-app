# C strncat_s function

last modified April 8, 2025

String operations are fundamental in C programming, and strncat_s is a
key function for safe string concatenation. This tutorial covers
strncat_s in depth, including its syntax, usage, and advantages over
unsafe alternatives. We'll explore practical examples and discuss why safe
functions matter in modern C programming. Understanding strncat_s
helps prevent buffer overflows while maintaining program safety.

## What Is strncat_s?

The strncat_s function safely concatenates a portion of one string to
another. It's declared in string.h and takes four parameters: the
destination buffer, its size, source string, and maximum characters to append.
Unlike strcat, it performs bounds checking to prevent buffer
overflows. This function is part of C11's Annex K bounds-checking interfaces.

## Why Use strncat_s Instead of strcat?

strcat is unsafe because it doesn't check destination buffer size,
leading to potential buffer overflows. strncat_s adds crucial safety
checks by requiring the destination size parameter. It also ensures proper null
termination of the result. These features make strncat_s essential
for secure programming. Always prefer it over strcat in new code.

## Basic strncat_s Usage

This example demonstrates basic string concatenation using strncat_s.

basic_concat.c
  

#define __STDC_WANT_LIB_EXT1__ 1
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;string.h&gt;

int main() {
    char dest[20] = "Hello";
    const char *src = ", World!";
    
    // Safe concatenation with bounds checking
    errno_t result = strncat_s(dest, sizeof(dest), src, 5);

    if (result == 0) {
        printf("Concatenated string: %s\n", dest);
    } else {
        printf("Error occurred during concatenation\n");
    }

    return 0;
}

Here, strncat_s appends up to 5 characters from src to
dest. The function checks that dest has enough space
remaining. It returns zero on success and non-zero on failure. This example
shows the basic pattern of checking the return value for errors.

## Concatenating with Full Source Length

This example shows concatenation using the entire source string length.

full_concat.c
  

#define __STDC_WANT_LIB_EXT1__ 1
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;string.h&gt;

int main() {
    char dest[30] = "Programming in ";
    const char *src = "C is powerful";
    
    // Concatenate entire source string safely
    errno_t result = strncat_s(dest, sizeof(dest), src, strlen(src));

    if (result == 0) {
        printf("Complete string: %s\n", dest);
    } else {
        printf("Concatenation failed: buffer too small\n");
    }

    return 0;
}

This code concatenates the entire source string by specifying its length with
strlen(src). The destination buffer is large enough to hold the
result. The function still performs bounds checking to ensure safety.
strncat_s automatically adds a null terminator if space permits.

## Handling Buffer Overflow Scenarios

This example demonstrates how strncat_s handles buffer overflow.

overflow_concat.c
  

#define __STDC_WANT_LIB_EXT1__ 1
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;string.h&gt;

int main() {
    char dest[10] = "Test";
    const char *src = "This is too long";
    
    // Attempt concatenation that will overflow
    errno_t result = strncat_s(dest, sizeof(dest), src, strlen(src));

    if (result != 0) {
        printf("Error %d: Buffer overflow prevented\n", result);
    } else {
        printf("Unexpected success - buffer should be too small\n");
    }

    return 0;
}

Here, strncat_s detects that the destination buffer is too small
and returns an error code. This prevents buffer overflow vulnerabilities that
could crash the program or be exploited. The function fails safely rather than
continuing with potentially dangerous operation. Always check the return value.

## Partial String Concatenation

This example shows how to concatenate only part of a source string.

partial_concat.c
  

#define __STDC_WANT_LIB_EXT1__ 1
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;string.h&gt;

int main() {
    char dest[20] = "Selected: ";
    const char *src = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ";
    
    // Concatenate only first 5 characters
    errno_t result = strncat_s(dest, sizeof(dest), src, 5);

    if (result == 0) {
        printf("Result: %s\n", dest);
    } else {
        printf("Concatenation failed\n");
    }

    return 0;
}

The code appends only the first 5 characters from the source string. The count
parameter limits how many characters are copied, regardless of the source
length. This is useful when you need to extract a substring during
concatenation. The destination buffer must still have enough space for the
selected characters plus null terminator.

## Concatenating Multiple Strings

This example demonstrates safe concatenation of multiple strings.

multi_concat.c
  

#define __STDC_WANT_LIB_EXT1__ 1
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;string.h&gt;

int main() {
    char dest[50] = "Components: ";
    const char *parts[] = {"CPU", "RAM", "SSD", "GPU"};
    
    // Safely concatenate multiple strings
    for (int i = 0; i &lt; 4; i++) {
        errno_t result = strncat_s(dest, sizeof(dest), parts[i], strlen(parts[i]));
        if (result != 0) {
            printf("Stopped: buffer full at component %d\n", i);
            break;
        }
        if (i &lt; 3) {
            strncat_s(dest, sizeof(dest), ", ", 2);
        }
    }

    printf("Final string: %s\n", dest);
    return 0;
}

This code safely builds a string from multiple components with separators.
Each concatenation checks for available space. The loop breaks if the buffer
fills prematurely. This pattern is common when constructing strings from
multiple sources. Always maintain proper buffer size accounting in such cases.

## Best Practices for Using strncat_s

- **Always check return values:** Handle errors appropriately when they occur.

- **Size destination buffers properly:** Include space for null terminators.

- **Prefer sizeof with arrays:** Use sizeof(dest) for array destinations.

- **Initialize destination strings:** Ensure destination is properly null-terminated before use.

- **Consider platform availability:** Not all implementations support Annex K functions.
