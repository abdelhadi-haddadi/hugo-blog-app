# C sprintf function

last modified April 6, 2025

String formatting is a crucial skill in C programming, enabling you to create
formatted strings efficiently. The sprintf function is a powerful
tool for this purpose, but requires careful use to avoid buffer overflows. This
tutorial explains sprintf in depth, demonstrates its usage, and
shows safer alternatives like snprintf. Mastering string formatting
ensures robust text processing and output generation in your programs.

## What Is sprintf?

The sprintf function in C writes formatted data to a string buffer.
It works like printf, but stores the result in memory instead of
printing to stdout. The function takes a destination buffer, format string, and
optional arguments. While powerful, sprintf is unsafe as it doesn't
check buffer size. Always prefer snprintf when security matters.

## Basic sprintf Example

Let's start with a simple example demonstrating basic string formatting.

basic_sprintf.c
  

#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main() {
    char buffer[100];
    int age = 25;
    float height = 1.75f;
    
    sprintf(buffer, "I am %d years old and %.2f meters tall.", age, height);
    
    printf("Formatted string: %s\n", buffer);
    return 0;
}

This example formats an integer and float into a string using sprintf.
The format specifiers %d and %.2f control how values
appear. The buffer must be large enough to hold the result. The formatted string
is then printed using printf.

## Formatting Multiple Values

sprintf can format multiple values of different types into a single
string.

multi_format.c
  

#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main() {
    char result[150];
    char name[] = "Alice";
    int score = 95;
    double average = 87.456;
    
    sprintf(result, "Student: %s\nScore: %d/100\nClass average: %.1f%%", 
            name, score, average);
    
    puts(result);
    return 0;
}

This code formats a student record with string, integer, and floating-point
values. The %% in the format string produces a literal percent sign.
Note the buffer size (150) is larger than the expected output to prevent
overflow. The puts function prints the complete formatted string.

## Safe Alternative: snprintf

The snprintf function is the safe version of sprintf.

safe_snprintf.c
  

#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main() {
    char buffer[20];
    int written = snprintf(buffer, sizeof(buffer), 
                         "The answer is %d", 42);
    
    if (written &gt;= sizeof(buffer)) {
        printf("Warning: Truncation occurred\n");
    }
    
    printf("Buffer: '%s'\n", buffer);
    printf("Characters written: %d\n", written);
    return 0;
}

snprintf takes the buffer size as second argument, preventing buffer
overflows. It returns the number of characters that would be written if the
buffer was large enough. This lets you detect truncation. Always use
snprintf instead of sprintf in production code.

## Building File Paths

sprintf is useful for constructing file paths dynamically.

file_path.c
  

#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main() {
    char path[256];
    int user_id = 42;
    
    sprintf(path, "/home/user%d/data/file.txt", user_id);
    
    printf("Constructed path: %s\n", path);
    
    // Now using snprintf for safety
    snprintf(path, sizeof(path), 
            "/home/user%d/data/file.txt", user_id);
    
    printf("Safe path: %s\n", path);
    return 0;
}

This example shows how to build file paths by inserting numeric IDs. The first
version uses sprintf which is risky if the buffer is too small. The
second version demonstrates the safer snprintf approach. Always
ensure your buffer is large enough for the worst-case scenario.

## Formatting Date Strings

Create custom date formats using sprintf with date components.

date_format.c
  

#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main() {
    char date_str[50];
    int year = 2025;
    int month = 4;
    int day = 6;
    
    sprintf(date_str, "%04d-%02d-%02d", year, month, day);
    
    printf("ISO date format: %s\n", date_str);
    
    // Alternative format
    sprintf(date_str, "%d/%d/%d", month, day, year);
    printf("US date format: %s\n", date_str);
    
    return 0;
}

This code formats date components into different string representations. The
%04d ensures 4-digit years with leading zeros. The
%02d formats months and days as two digits. The second
sprintf demonstrates a different date format common in the US.

## Best Practices for String Formatting

- **Prefer snprintf:** Always use snprintf instead of sprintf for safety.

- **Check Buffer Size:** Ensure your buffer is large enough for the worst-case output.

- **Validate Input:** Check values before formatting to prevent unexpected results.

- **Handle Errors:** Check snprintf return value for truncation.

- **Use Constants:** Define buffer sizes as constants for easy maintenance.
