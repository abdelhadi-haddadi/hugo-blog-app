# Excel DEC2BIN and HEX2DEC Functions

last modified April 4, 2025

The DEC2BIN and HEX2DEC functions are essential for 
working with number systems in Excel. DEC2BIN converts decimal 
numbers to binary, while HEX2DEC converts hexadecimal to decimal. 
This tutorial provides a comprehensive guide to using these functions with 
detailed examples. You'll learn syntax, practical applications, and important 
limitations of these conversion functions.

## Function Basics

DEC2BIN converts decimal numbers to binary representation, while 
HEX2DEC converts hexadecimal numbers to decimal. These functions 
are particularly useful in computer science and digital electronics.

  
    Function
    Description
    Syntax
  
  
    DEC2BIN
    Converts decimal to binary
    =DEC2BIN(number, [places])
  
  
    HEX2DEC
    Converts hexadecimal to decimal
    =HEX2DEC(number)
  

This table shows the basic information about both functions. DEC2BIN 
has an optional places parameter to pad the result with leading zeros.

## DEC2BIN Basic Example

This example demonstrates the simplest use of DEC2BIN to convert a 
decimal number to its binary representation.

Basic DEC2BIN formula
  

=DEC2BIN(10)

This formula converts the decimal number 10 to binary. The result will be "1010". 
The function automatically determines the minimum number of bits needed.

## DEC2BIN with Places Parameter

The optional places parameter specifies the minimum number of characters in the 
result. This example shows how to pad the binary result with leading zeros.

DEC2BIN with places
  

=DEC2BIN(5, 8)

This formula converts decimal 5 to an 8-bit binary number. The result is 
"00000101". The places parameter ensures the output has exactly 8 characters.

## HEX2DEC Basic Example

This example shows the basic usage of HEX2DEC to convert a 
hexadecimal number to decimal.

Basic HEX2DEC formula
  

=HEX2DEC("A")

This formula converts the hexadecimal value "A" (which equals 10 in decimal) to 
its decimal equivalent. The result will be 10. Both uppercase and lowercase hex 
digits work.

## HEX2DEC with Multi-digit Hexadecimal

HEX2DEC can handle multi-digit hexadecimal numbers. This example 
converts a two-digit hex value to decimal.

HEX2DEC with two-digit hex
  

=HEX2DEC("FF")

This formula converts hexadecimal "FF" to decimal. The result is 255, which is 
the maximum value for an 8-bit unsigned integer. The function handles hex 
strings up to 10 characters.

## DEC2BIN with Negative Numbers

DEC2BIN can represent negative numbers using two's complement 
notation. This example shows how negative decimal numbers are converted.

DEC2BIN with negative number
  

=DEC2BIN(-5)

This formula converts decimal -5 to its 10-bit two's complement binary 
representation. The result is "1111111011". The function always uses 10 bits 
for negative numbers.

## HEX2DEC with Large Values

HEX2DEC can handle large hexadecimal values. This example converts 
a 10-character hex string to decimal.

HEX2DEC with large value
  

=HEX2DEC("FFFFFFFFFE")

This formula converts the 10-character hex value "FFFFFFFFFE" to decimal. The 
result is -2. Negative values are represented using two's complement notation 
when the leftmost bit is 1.

## DEC2BIN Limitations

DEC2BIN has specific limitations regarding input range and output 
length. This example demonstrates these limits.

DEC2BIN with maximum input
  

=DEC2BIN(511)

This formula converts the maximum positive decimal number (511) that 
DEC2BIN can handle. The result is "111111111" (9 bits). For 
negative numbers, the limit is -512. Attempting larger values returns #NUM!.

## Combining DEC2BIN and HEX2DEC

These functions can be combined to convert between different number systems. This 
example converts hexadecimal to binary via decimal.

Hex to binary conversion
  

=DEC2BIN(HEX2DEC("A5"))

This formula first converts hex "A5" to decimal (165), then converts that to 
binary. The result is "10100101". This technique is useful when direct hex to 
binary conversion isn't available.

## Practical Application Example

These functions are often used in digital systems. This example shows how to 
convert an IP address component from decimal to binary.

IP address component conversion
  

=DEC2BIN(192, 8)

This formula converts the decimal IP address component 192 to 8-bit binary 
"11000000". The places parameter ensures proper 8-bit formatting for each 
octet in an IP address.

The DEC2BIN and HEX2DEC functions are powerful tools 
for number system conversions in Excel. While DEC2BIN handles 
decimal to binary conversion with optional padding, HEX2DEC 
converts hexadecimal to decimal. Understanding their limitations and combining 
them can solve complex conversion problems in digital systems and programming.
