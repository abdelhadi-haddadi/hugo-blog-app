# Python sqlite3.Cursor.setoutputsize Method

Last modified April 15, 2025

This guide explores Python's sqlite3.Cursor.setoutputsize method,
which is part of the DB-API 2.0 specification but not implemented in SQLite.

## Basic Definitions

The setoutputsize method is defined in Python's DB-API 2.0
specification for database cursors. It's meant to predefine memory allocation.

In SQLite's implementation, this method exists but does nothing. It's provided
for API compatibility with other database systems that might use this feature.

## Method Signature

The method has the following signature:
setoutputsize(size, column=None). Both parameters are optional.

size specifies the expected output size in bytes. column
can specify a particular column index. The method returns None in all cases.

## Basic Usage

This example shows the basic syntax of calling the method, though it has no
effect in SQLite.

basic_usage.py
  

import sqlite3

with sqlite3.connect(':memory:') as conn:
    with conn.cursor() as cur:
        # This call does nothing in SQLite
        cur.setoutputsize(1024)  # 1KB expected output
        
        cur.execute("CREATE TABLE test (data TEXT)")
        cur.execute("INSERT INTO test VALUES ('Sample data')")
        conn.commit()
        
        cur.execute("SELECT * FROM test")
        print(cur.fetchone())  # ('Sample data',)

The setoutputsize call is present but doesn't affect the query
results or memory usage. The method exists for API compatibility only.

## With Column Parameter

This example demonstrates using the optional column parameter, which also has no
effect in SQLite.

with_column.py
  

import sqlite3

with sqlite3.connect(':memory:') as conn:
    with conn.cursor() as cur:
        # Specify output size for column 0
        cur.setoutputsize(2048, 0)  # No effect
        
        cur.execute("""CREATE TABLE products
                     (id INTEGER, name TEXT, price REAL)""")
        
        data = [(1, 'Laptop', 999.99),
                (2, 'Phone', 699.99)]
        cur.executemany("INSERT INTO products VALUES (?, ?, ?)", data)
        
        cur.execute("SELECT * FROM products")
        for row in cur:
            print(row)

The column index parameter (0 in this case) would specify which column to
pre-allocate memory for in databases that support this feature.

## In Transaction

This example shows the method being called within a transaction block.

in_transaction.py
  

import sqlite3

with sqlite3.connect('transactions.db') as conn:
    conn.isolation_level = 'EXCLUSIVE'
    with conn:
        cur = conn.cursor()
        cur.setoutputsize(4096)  # Still no effect
        
        cur.execute("CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS logs (message TEXT)")
        cur.execute("INSERT INTO logs VALUES ('Transaction started')")
        
        # The transaction commits automatically when exiting 'with' block

Even within an explicit transaction, the method has no effect on SQLite's
behavior. The transaction proceeds normally regardless of this call.

## With Large Data

This example attempts to use the method with potentially large data.

large_data.py
  

import sqlite3

with sqlite3.connect(':memory:') as conn:
    with conn.cursor() as cur:
        # Try to pre-allocate for large BLOB
        cur.setoutputsize(10*1024*1024)  # 10MB
        
        # Create table with BLOB column
        cur.execute("CREATE TABLE blobs (id INTEGER, data BLOB)")
        
        # Insert 5MB of data
        data = b'\x01' * 5*1024*1024
        cur.execute("INSERT INTO blobs VALUES (1, ?)", (data,))
        
        cur.execute("SELECT data FROM blobs WHERE id = 1")
        retrieved = cur.fetchone()[0]
        print(f"Retrieved {len(retrieved)//1024}KB of data")

SQLite handles the large BLOB data without needing pre-allocation hints. The
method call doesn't affect memory usage or performance in this scenario.

## Multiple Calls

This example shows multiple calls to the method with different parameters.

multiple_calls.py
  

import sqlite3

with sqlite3.connect('example.db') as conn:
    with conn.cursor() as cur:
        # Multiple calls with different sizes
        cur.setoutputsize(1024)
        cur.setoutputsize(2048, 0)
        cur.setoutputsize(4096, 1)
        
        cur.execute("""CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS measurements
                     (timestamp TEXT, value REAL, unit TEXT)""")
        
        import time
        current_time = time.strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')
        cur.execute("INSERT INTO measurements VALUES (?, ?, ?)",
                   (current_time, 23.5, 'Celsius'))
        
        cur.execute("SELECT * FROM measurements")
        print(cur.fetchall())

Multiple calls to the method are allowed but have no cumulative effect. Each call
is effectively ignored by the SQLite driver.

## With Custom Row Factory

This example combines the method with a custom row factory.

with_row_factory.py
  

import sqlite3

def dict_factory(cursor, row):
    return {col[0]: row[idx] for idx, col in enumerate(cursor.description)}

with sqlite3.connect(':memory:') as conn:
    conn.row_factory = dict_factory
    with conn.cursor() as cur:
        cur.setoutputsize(512)  # No effect on row factory
        
        cur.execute("CREATE TABLE books (title TEXT, author TEXT, year INTEGER)")
        cur.execute("INSERT INTO books VALUES (?, ?, ?)",
                   ('Python Cookbook', 'David Beazley', 2013))
        
        cur.execute("SELECT * FROM books")
        print(cur.fetchone())  # {'title': 'Python Cookbook', ...}

The custom row factory works normally regardless of the setoutputsize
call. The method doesn't interact with row factory behavior in any way.

## Error Cases

This example shows that the method doesn't raise errors with invalid parameters.

error_cases.py
  

import sqlite3

with sqlite3.connect(':memory:') as conn:
    with conn.cursor() as cur:
        # These calls are all accepted but do nothing
        cur.setoutputsize(-100)  # Negative size
        cur.setoutputsize(0)
        cur.setoutputsize(1.5)  # Float size
        cur.setoutputsize(100, -1)  # Invalid column
        cur.setoutputsize(100, 1000)  # Out of bounds column
        
        cur.execute("SELECT 1")
        print(cur.fetchone())  # (1,)

The SQLite implementation accepts any parameters without validation since the
method doesn't actually perform any operations. This differs from some other
database systems.

## Best Practices

- **Understand it's a no-op:** The method exists for API compatibility only

- **Don't rely on it:** SQLite manages memory automatically

- **Document usage:** If used, comment why it's present

- **Consider alternatives:** For performance, optimize queries instead

- **Test thoroughly:** If switching databases, behavior may differ
